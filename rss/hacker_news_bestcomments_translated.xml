Some of those descendants are very successful now and some descendants of slave owners are probably very poor now. And some people are descendants of both. And then I learn about the Jim Crow period, and then you hear that even the GI bill explicitly excluded black people, and lynchings into the 1950s, and the extremely hard fight the civil rights movement had, and even legal discrimination up to 1971, not to mention tons of possibly illegal but still very real discrimination after that. And then I think: you can&#39;t just stop doing a bad thing and pretend it didn&#39;t happen. You&#39;ve got to try to make things right. Have things been made right by now? I have no idea. I do know plenty of black people still live in fear of the police, and that when black people call the police, there&#39;s the non-zero chance that they&#39;re the ones who end up getting shot. Not to mention that many universities also have affirmative action for children of alumni, who are still predominantly white and rich, partially because of the legal discrimination uo to 1971, and partially because universities are ridiculously expensive. Has that affirmative action also been struck down? >; America is not in the least social-democratic, It used to be, though. The New Deal and many of the social policies of the 1940s and 1950s were very social democratic. Well, except that they tended to exclude black people. ]]>; Thu, 29 Jun 2023 15:57:26 +0000</span> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36522205 mcv https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36522205 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36522205 >; I assume the intent is to help disadvantaged people have opportunities that more priviledged people have already. Right? I mean, I can get behind that. But then why the entire detour with race? Up until about 1971 (possibly later, but that&#39;s the date of <i>Loving vs Virginia</i> ), the US had formal, legal discrimination against black people. On finally removing that, there was at various times discussion of whether people who had been legally discriminated against all their lives should be compensated, as if they had been wronged in a tort sense. This would obviously be extremely expensive, and anyway impossible to quantify, so it never happened. Harvard, and many other colleges, has a big base of &quot;legacy&quot; admissions, as well as a certain amount of generational knowledge and connections - you&#39;re more likely to get into Harvard if your parents went to Harvard, over and above mere class status. Since black people were under-represented in this category, people came up with the idea of putting a thumb on the other side of the scale and artificially increasing their rate of admission. Can it balance exactly against the disadvantages of discrimination? No. >; I genuinely don&#39;t get why the race thing is part of the equation. Shouldn&#39;t this just be run-of-the-mill social democratic &quot;lets hand out some extra opportunities/benefits to the poor&quot; program? America is not in the least social-democratic, but racism and anti-racism have been there since the beginning and will probably dominate US politics until the last person who remembers the KKK is dead. (It could be worse: Haitians who had freed themselves from slavery by the mass murder of their oppressors were made to pay a huge amount of compensation to them!) ]]>; Thu, 29 Jun 2023 15:47:11 +0000</span> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36522049 pjc50 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36522049 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36522049 The concept of affirmative action is foreign to me (quite literally so). I only know it from American media, and I&#39;ve come understand it to mean &quot;positively discriminate based on race, so long as it&#39;s a minority race&quot; - please correct me of I&#39;m wrong. But anyway, my question for the Americans here who grok this stuff: I assume the intent is to help disadvantaged people have opportunities that more priviledged people have already. Right? I mean, I can get behind that. But then why the entire detour with race? Why not just.. well, let poor people come first?

Affirmative Action probably helped my father, whose father was a construction worker and mother a homemaker both of whom dropped out of high school, get into college and ultimately become a doctor. But because my father was a doctor, I had a fairly privileged upbringing. I&#39;m a generation removed, but growing up in California always had to indicate my background on standardized tests and always checked &quot;White&quot; for race and then &quot;Hispanic&quot; for ethnicity (which is how all the tests asked it in those days, not sure if it&#39;s still the case), without thinking much about it. I went to MIT, and to this day I wonder how much checking &quot;Hispanic&quot; helped me there and if I &quot;deserved&quot; to go. I was valedictorian and had a perfect score on the SATs and I feel like I was a strong candidate, but then everyone who gets into MIT is strong. And since I did successfully graduate then I guess it was fine that I was accepted, but I was constantly blown away and overwhelmed by the accomplishments of my peers there, and always wondered a bit if I belonged. I&#39;ve always had an identity crisis about what I am. I know in the current zeitgeist there&#39;s a big push for racial justice, of which being Hispanic and &quot;brown&quot; is a part. But it also feels totally irrelevant to me, personally, because of my upper class upbringing and elite education, and I feel like I&#39;ve never really been discriminated against. Though I possibly have been discriminated &quot;for&quot;, and benefited tremendously from it. So I don&#39;t know how I feel about this change. It&#39;s certainly a big one, but in the long run, maybe it&#39;s good? I know I&#39;ve always wondered if being Hispanic helped me get into college or into jobs, but the flip side is that other people must wonder the same... ]]>; Thu, 29 Jun 2023 14:40:31 +0000</span> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36520992 losvedir https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36520992 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36520992 I don&#39;t buy this.

While I am in Europe.<code> If you have users in Sydney, Australia ... ... you are floored at 104ms of latency for your request</code> When I open AirBnB with a clean browser cache, it takes several seconds until I see something useful. Those 104ms of latency don&#39;t make a dent. Reddit takes over 5 seconds until the cookie banner is ready for me to click it away. Twitter takes 6 seconds to load the homepage and display the single tweet which fits on it.<code> preview images take a little longer to load</code> Preview images of what?

Affirmative Action probably helped my father, whose father was a construction worker and mother a homemaker both of whom dropped out of high school, get into college and ultimately become a doctor.

But it also feels totally irrelevant to me, personally, because of my upper class upbringing and elite education, and I feel like I&#39;ve never really been discriminated against. Though I possibly have been discriminated &quot;for&quot;, and benefited tremendously from it. So I don&#39;t know how I feel about this change. It&#39;s certainly a big one, but in the long run, maybe it&#39;s good?

And advertisement is the rich asking for more money. A man would be annoyed if he found himself in a mob of millionaires, all holding out their silk hats for a penny; or all shouting with one voice, “Give me money.” Yet advertisement does really assault the eye very much as such a shout would assault the ear. “Budge&#39;s Boots are the Best” simply means “Give me money”; “Use Seraphic Soap” simply means “Give me money.” It is a complete mistake to suppose that common people make our towns commonplace, with unsightly things like advertisements. Most of those whose wares are thus placarded everywhere are very wealthy gentlemen with coronets and country seats, men who are probably very particular about the artistic adornment of their own homes.

It&#39;s because they&#39;ve become increasingly obnoxious. Nobody blocked ads when they were a simple column of links in the gutter or maybe an animated GIF banner with 3 frames. No, adblockers became popular because ads kept getting more loud (both visually and audibly), in your face, and resource hungry (remember those flash ads that&#39;d keep your CPU pegged?).

Some of those descendants are very successful now and some descendants of slave owners are probably very poor now. And some people are descendants of both. And then I learn about the Jim Crow period, and then you hear that even the GI bill explicitly excluded black people, and lynchings into the 1950s, and the extremely hard fight the civil rights movement had, and even legal discrimination up to 1971, not to mention tons of possibly illegal but still very real discrimination after that. And then I think: you can&#39;t just stop doing a bad thing and pretend it didn&#39;t happen. You&#39;ve got to try to make things right. Have things been made right by now? I have no idea. I do know plenty of black people still live in fear of the police, and that when black people call the police, there&#39;s the non-zero chance that they&#39;re the ones who end up getting shot. Not to mention that many universities also have affirmative action for children of alumni, who are still predominantly white and rich, partially because of the legal discrimination uo to 1971, and partially because universities are ridiculously expensive. Has that affirmative action also been struck down? >; America is not in the least social-democratic, It used to be, though.

Right? I mean, I can get behind that. But then why the entire detour with race? Up until about 1971 (possibly later, but that&#39;s the date of <i>Loving vs Virginia</i> ), the US had formal, legal discrimination against black people. On finally removing that, there was at various times discussion of whether people who had been legally discriminated against all their lives should be compensated, as if they had been wronged in a tort sense. This would obviously be extremely expensive, and anyway impossible to quantify, so it never happened. Harvard, and many other colleges, has a big base of &quot;legacy&quot; admissions, as well as a certain amount of generational knowledge and connections - you&#39;re more likely to get into Harvard if your parents went to Harvard, over and above mere class status. Since black people were under-represented in this category, people came up with the idea of putting a thumb on the other side of the scale and artificially increasing their rate of admission. Can it balance exactly against the disadvantages of discrimination? No. >; I genuinely don&#39;t get why the race thing is part of the equation. Shouldn&#39;t this just be run-of-the-mill social democratic &quot;lets hand out some extra opportunities/benefits to the poor&quot; program? America is not in the least social-democratic, but racism and anti-racism have been there since the beginning and will probably dominate US politics until the last person who remembers the KKK is dead.

But it also feels totally irrelevant to me, personally, because of my upper class upbringing and elite education, and I feel like I&#39;ve never really been discriminated against. Though I possibly have been discriminated &quot;for&quot;, and benefited tremendously from it. So I don&#39;t know how I feel about this change. It&#39;s certainly a big one, but in the long run, maybe it&#39;s good?

And advertisement is the rich asking for more money. A man would be annoyed if he found himself in a mob of millionaires, all holding out their silk hats for a penny; or all shouting with one voice, “Give me money.” Yet advertisement does really assault the eye very much as such a shout would assault the ear. “Budge&#39;s Boots are the Best” simply means “Give me money”; “Use Seraphic Soap” simply means “Give me money.” It is a complete mistake to suppose that common people make our towns commonplace, with unsightly things like advertisements. Most of those whose wares are thus placarded everywhere are very wealthy gentlemen with coronets and country seats, men who are probably very particular about the artistic adornment of their own homes.

It&#39;s because they&#39;ve become increasingly obnoxious. Nobody blocked ads when they were a simple column of links in the gutter or maybe an animated GIF banner with 3 frames. No, adblockers became popular because ads kept getting more loud (both visually and audibly), in your face, and resource hungry (remember those flash ads that&#39;d keep your CPU pegged?).

Some of those descendants are very successful now and some descendants of slave owners are probably very poor now. And some people are descendants of both. And then I learn about the Jim Crow period, and then you hear that even the GI bill explicitly excluded black people, and lynchings into the 1950s, and the extremely hard fight the civil rights movement had, and even legal discrimination up to 1971, not to mention tons of possibly illegal but still very real discrimination after that. And then I think: you can&#39;t just stop doing a bad thing and pretend it didn&#39;t happen. You&#39;ve got to try to make things right. Have things been made right by now? I have no idea. I do know plenty of black people still live in fear of the police, and that when black people call the police, there&#39;s the non-zero chance that they&#39;re the ones who end up getting shot. Not to mention that many universities also have affirmative action for children of alumni, who are still predominantly white and rich, partially because of the legal discrimination uo to 1971, and partially because universities are ridiculously expensive. Has that affirmative action also been struck down? >; America is not in the least social-democratic, It used to be, though.

Right? I mean, I can get behind that. But then why the entire detour with race? Up until about 1971 (possibly later, but that&#39;s the date of <i>Loving vs Virginia</i> ), the US had formal, legal discrimination against black people. On finally removing that, there was at various times discussion of whether people who had been legally discriminated against all their lives should be compensated, as if they had been wronged in a tort sense. This would obviously be extremely expensive, and anyway impossible to quantify, so it never happened. Harvard, and many other colleges, has a big base of &quot;legacy&quot; admissions, as well as a certain amount of generational knowledge and connections - you&#39;re more likely to get into Harvard if your parents went to Harvard, over and above mere class status. Since black people were under-represented in this category, people came up with the idea of putting a thumb on the other side of the scale and artificially increasing their rate of admission. Can it balance exactly against the disadvantages of discrimination? No. >; I genuinely don&#39;t get why the race thing is part of the equation. Shouldn&#39;t this just be run-of-the-mill social democratic &quot;lets hand out some extra opportunities/benefits to the poor&quot; program? America is not in the least social-democratic, but racism and anti-racism have been there since the beginning and will probably dominate US politics until the last person who remembers the KKK is dead.

Affirmative Action probably helped my father, whose father was a construction worker and mother a homemaker both of whom dropped out of high school, get into college and ultimately become a doctor. But because my father was a doctor, I had a fairly privileged upbringing. I&#39;m a generation removed, but growing up in California always had to indicate my background on standardized tests and always checked &quot;White&quot; for race and then &quot;Hispanic&quot; for ethnicity (which is how all the tests asked it in those days, not sure if it&#39;s still the case), without thinking much about it. I went to MIT, and to this day I wonder how much checking &quot;Hispanic&quot; helped me there and if I &quot;deserved&quot; to go.

I&#39;ve always had an identity crisis about what I am. I know in the current zeitgeist there&#39;s a big push for racial justice, of which being Hispanic and &quot;brown&quot; is a part. But it also feels totally irrelevant to me, personally, because of my upper class upbringing and elite education, and I feel like I&#39;ve never really been discriminated against. Though I possibly have been discriminated &quot;for&quot;, and benefited tremendously from it. So I don&#39;t know how I feel about this change. It&#39;s certainly a big one, but in the long run, maybe it&#39;s good? I know I&#39;ve always wondered if being Hispanic helped me get into college or into jobs, but the flip side is that other people must wonder the same... ]]>; Thu, 29 Jun 2023 14:40:31 +0000</span> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36520992 losvedir https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36520992 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36520992 I don&#39;t buy this.

And advertisement is the rich asking for more money. A man would be annoyed if he found himself in a mob of millionaires, all holding out their silk hats for a penny; or all shouting with one voice, “Give me money.” Yet advertisement does really assault the eye very much as such a shout would assault the ear. “Budge&#39;s Boots are the Best” simply means “Give me money”; “Use Seraphic Soap” simply means “Give me money.” It is a complete mistake to suppose that common people make our towns commonplace, with unsightly things like advertisements. Most of those whose wares are thus placarded everywhere are very wealthy gentlemen with coronets and country seats, men who are probably very particular about the artistic adornment of their own homes. They disfigure their towns in order to decorate their houses. — GK Chesterton, <i>The New Jersusalem</i> <a href="http://www.gkc.org.uk/gkc/books/GKC_New_Jerusalem.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.gkc.org.uk/gkc/books/GKC_New_Jerusalem.html</a> ]]>; Fri, 30 Jun 2023 16:11:03 +0000</span> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 lolinder https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 I block ads because they&#39;re psychological warfare that corporations wage against me. I don&#39;t care how unobtrusive the ads are. I don&#39;t care if the ads don&#39;t track me.

I have zero tolerance for ads of any sort. Advertisers have no morals, they&#39;re completely depraved. They&#39;ll eagerly exploit a teenager&#39;s self-conscious body issues to sell useless beauty products.

It&#39;s because they&#39;ve become increasingly obnoxious. Nobody blocked ads when they were a simple column of links in the gutter or maybe an animated GIF banner with 3 frames. No, adblockers became popular because ads kept getting more loud (both visually and audibly), in your face, and resource hungry (remember those flash ads that&#39;d keep your CPU pegged?).

Some of those descendants are very successful now and some descendants of slave owners are probably very poor now. And some people are descendants of both. And then I learn about the Jim Crow period, and then you hear that even the GI bill explicitly excluded black people, and lynchings into the 1950s, and the extremely hard fight the civil rights movement had, and even legal discrimination up to 1971, not to mention tons of possibly illegal but still very real discrimination after that. And then I think: you can&#39;t just stop doing a bad thing and pretend it didn&#39;t happen. You&#39;ve got to try to make things right. Have things been made right by now? I have no idea. I do know plenty of black people still live in fear of the police, and that when black people call the police, there&#39;s the non-zero chance that they&#39;re the ones who end up getting shot. Not to mention that many universities also have affirmative action for children of alumni, who are still predominantly white and rich, partially because of the legal discrimination uo to 1971, and partially because universities are ridiculously expensive. Has that affirmative action also been struck down? >; America is not in the least social-democratic, It used to be, though.

Right? I mean, I can get behind that. But then why the entire detour with race? Up until about 1971 (possibly later, but that&#39;s the date of <i>Loving vs Virginia</i> ), the US had formal, legal discrimination against black people. On finally removing that, there was at various times discussion of whether people who had been legally discriminated against all their lives should be compensated, as if they had been wronged in a tort sense. This would obviously be extremely expensive, and anyway impossible to quantify, so it never happened. Harvard, and many other colleges, has a big base of &quot;legacy&quot; admissions, as well as a certain amount of generational knowledge and connections - you&#39;re more likely to get into Harvard if your parents went to Harvard, over and above mere class status. Since black people were under-represented in this category, people came up with the idea of putting a thumb on the other side of the scale and artificially increasing their rate of admission. Can it balance exactly against the disadvantages of discrimination? No. >; I genuinely don&#39;t get why the race thing is part of the equation. Shouldn&#39;t this just be run-of-the-mill social democratic &quot;lets hand out some extra opportunities/benefits to the poor&quot; program? America is not in the least social-democratic, but racism and anti-racism have been there since the beginning and will probably dominate US politics until the last person who remembers the KKK is dead.

But it also feels totally irrelevant to me, personally, because of my upper class upbringing and elite education, and I feel like I&#39;ve never really been discriminated against. Though I possibly have been discriminated &quot;for&quot;, and benefited tremendously from it. So I don&#39;t know how I feel about this change. It&#39;s certainly a big one, but in the long run, maybe it&#39;s good?

And advertisement is the rich asking for more money. A man would be annoyed if he found himself in a mob of millionaires, all holding out their silk hats for a penny; or all shouting with one voice, “Give me money.” Yet advertisement does really assault the eye very much as such a shout would assault the ear. “Budge&#39;s Boots are the Best” simply means “Give me money”; “Use Seraphic Soap” simply means “Give me money.” It is a complete mistake to suppose that common people make our towns commonplace, with unsightly things like advertisements. Most of those whose wares are thus placarded everywhere are very wealthy gentlemen with coronets and country seats, men who are probably very particular about the artistic adornment of their own homes.

It&#39;s because they&#39;ve become increasingly obnoxious. Nobody blocked ads when they were a simple column of links in the gutter or maybe an animated GIF banner with 3 frames. No, adblockers became popular because ads kept getting more loud (both visually and audibly), in your face, and resource hungry (remember those flash ads that&#39;d keep your CPU pegged?).

Some of those descendants are very successful now and some descendants of slave owners are probably very poor now. And some people are descendants of both. And then I learn about the Jim Crow period, and then you hear that even the GI bill explicitly excluded black people, and lynchings into the 1950s, and the extremely hard fight the civil rights movement had, and even legal discrimination up to 1971, not to mention tons of possibly illegal but still very real discrimination after that. And then I think: you can&#39;t just stop doing a bad thing and pretend it didn&#39;t happen. You&#39;ve got to try to make things right. Have things been made right by now? I have no idea. I do know plenty of black people still live in fear of the police, and that when black people call the police, there&#39;s the non-zero chance that they&#39;re the ones who end up getting shot. Not to mention that many universities also have affirmative action for children of alumni, who are still predominantly white and rich, partially because of the legal discrimination uo to 1971, and partially because universities are ridiculously expensive. Has that affirmative action also been struck down? >; America is not in the least social-democratic, It used to be, though.

Right? I mean, I can get behind that. But then why the entire detour with race? Up until about 1971 (possibly later, but that&#39;s the date of <i>Loving vs Virginia</i> ), the US had formal, legal discrimination against black people. On finally removing that, there was at various times discussion of whether people who had been legally discriminated against all their lives should be compensated, as if they had been wronged in a tort sense. This would obviously be extremely expensive, and anyway impossible to quantify, so it never happened. Harvard, and many other colleges, has a big base of &quot;legacy&quot; admissions, as well as a certain amount of generational knowledge and connections - you&#39;re more likely to get into Harvard if your parents went to Harvard, over and above mere class status. Since black people were under-represented in this category, people came up with the idea of putting a thumb on the other side of the scale and artificially increasing their rate of admission. Can it balance exactly against the disadvantages of discrimination? No. >; I genuinely don&#39;t get why the race thing is part of the equation. Shouldn&#39;t this just be run-of-the-mill social democratic &quot;lets hand out some extra opportunities/benefits to the poor&quot; program? America is not in the least social-democratic, but racism and anti-racism have been there since the beginning and will probably dominate US politics until the last person who remembers the KKK is dead.

But it also feels totally irrelevant to me, personally, because of my upper class upbringing and elite education, and I feel like I&#39;ve never really been discriminated against. Though I possibly have been discriminated &quot;for&quot;, and benefited tremendously from it. So I don&#39;t know how I feel about this change. It&#39;s certainly a big one, but in the long run, maybe it&#39;s good?

And advertisement is the rich asking for more money. A man would be annoyed if he found himself in a mob of millionaires, all holding out their silk hats for a penny; or all shouting with one voice, “Give me money.” Yet advertisement does really assault the eye very much as such a shout would assault the ear. “Budge&#39;s Boots are the Best” simply means “Give me money”; “Use Seraphic Soap” simply means “Give me money.” It is a complete mistake to suppose that common people make our towns commonplace, with unsightly things like advertisements. Most of those whose wares are thus placarded everywhere are very wealthy gentlemen with coronets and country seats, men who are probably very particular about the artistic adornment of their own homes.

It&#39;s because they&#39;ve become increasingly obnoxious. Nobody blocked ads when they were a simple column of links in the gutter or maybe an animated GIF banner with 3 frames. No, adblockers became popular because ads kept getting more loud (both visually and audibly), in your face, and resource hungry (remember those flash ads that&#39;d keep your CPU pegged?).

Some of those descendants are very successful now and some descendants of slave owners are probably very poor now. And some people are descendants of both. And then I learn about the Jim Crow period, and then you hear that even the GI bill explicitly excluded black people, and lynchings into the 1950s, and the extremely hard fight the civil rights movement had, and even legal discrimination up to 1971, not to mention tons of possibly illegal but still very real discrimination after that. And then I think: you can&#39;t just stop doing a bad thing and pretend it didn&#39;t happen. You&#39;ve got to try to make things right. Have things been made right by now? I have no idea. I do know plenty of black people still live in fear of the police, and that when black people call the police, there&#39;s the non-zero chance that they&#39;re the ones who end up getting shot. Not to mention that many universities also have affirmative action for children of alumni, who are still predominantly white and rich, partially because of the legal discrimination uo to 1971, and partially because universities are ridiculously expensive. Has that affirmative action also been struck down? >; America is not in the least social-democratic, It used to be, though.

Right? I mean, I can get behind that. But then why the entire detour with race? Up until about 1971 (possibly later, but that&#39;s the date of <i>Loving vs Virginia</i> ), the US had formal, legal discrimination against black people. On finally removing that, there was at various times discussion of whether people who had been legally discriminated against all their lives should be compensated, as if they had been wronged in a tort sense. This would obviously be extremely expensive, and anyway impossible to quantify, so it never happened. Harvard, and many other colleges, has a big base of &quot;legacy&quot; admissions, as well as a certain amount of generational knowledge and connections - you&#39;re more likely to get into Harvard if your parents went to Harvard, over and above mere class status. Since black people were under-represented in this category, people came up with the idea of putting a thumb on the other side of the scale and artificially increasing their rate of admission. Can it balance exactly against the disadvantages of discrimination? No. >; I genuinely don&#39;t get why the race thing is part of the equation. Shouldn&#39;t this just be run-of-the-mill social democratic &quot;lets hand out some extra opportunities/benefits to the poor&quot; program? America is not in the least social-democratic, but racism and anti-racism have been there since the beginning and will probably dominate US politics until the last person who remembers the KKK is dead.

Affirmative Action probably helped my father, whose father was a construction worker and mother a homemaker both of whom dropped out of high school, get into college and ultimately become a doctor. But because my father was a doctor, I had a fairly privileged upbringing. I&#39;m a generation removed, but growing up in California always had to indicate my background on standardized tests and always checked &quot;White&quot; for race and then &quot;Hispanic&quot; for ethnicity (which is how all the tests asked it in those days, not sure if it&#39;s still the case), without thinking much about it. I went to MIT, and to this day I wonder how much checking &quot;Hispanic&quot; helped me there and if I &quot;deserved&quot; to go.

I&#39;ve always had an identity crisis about what I am. I know in the current zeitgeist there&#39;s a big push for racial justice, of which being Hispanic and &quot;brown&quot; is a part. But it also feels totally irrelevant to me, personally, because of my upper class upbringing and elite education, and I feel like I&#39;ve never really been discriminated against. Though I possibly have been discriminated &quot;for&quot;, and benefited tremendously from it. So I don&#39;t know how I feel about this change. It&#39;s certainly a big one, but in the long run, maybe it&#39;s good? I know I&#39;ve always wondered if being Hispanic helped me get into college or into jobs, but the flip side is that other people must wonder the same... ]]>; Thu, 29 Jun 2023 14:40:31 +0000</span> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36520992 losvedir https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36520992 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36520992 I don&#39;t buy this.

And advertisement is the rich asking for more money. A man would be annoyed if he found himself in a mob of millionaires, all holding out their silk hats for a penny; or all shouting with one voice, “Give me money.” Yet advertisement does really assault the eye very much as such a shout would assault the ear. “Budge&#39;s Boots are the Best” simply means “Give me money”; “Use Seraphic Soap” simply means “Give me money.” It is a complete mistake to suppose that common people make our towns commonplace, with unsightly things like advertisements. Most of those whose wares are thus placarded everywhere are very wealthy gentlemen with coronets and country seats, men who are probably very particular about the artistic adornment of their own homes. They disfigure their towns in order to decorate their houses. — GK Chesterton, <i>The New Jersusalem</i> <a href="http://www.gkc.org.uk/gkc/books/GKC_New_Jerusalem.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.gkc.org.uk/gkc/books/GKC_New_Jerusalem.html</a> ]]>; Fri, 30 Jun 2023 16:11:03 +0000</span> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 lolinder https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 I block ads because they&#39;re psychological warfare that corporations wage against me. I don&#39;t care how unobtrusive the ads are. I don&#39;t care if the ads don&#39;t track me. I grew up changing the channel on TV when ads came on, and ripping adverts out of magazines before sitting down to read them. I vote for billboard bans whenever I can. I have zero tolerance for ads of any sort. Advertisers have no morals, they&#39;re completely depraved. They&#39;ll eagerly exploit a teenager&#39;s self-conscious body issues to sell useless beauty products.

It&#39;s because they&#39;ve become increasingly obnoxious. Nobody blocked ads when they were a simple column of links in the gutter or maybe an animated GIF banner with 3 frames. No, adblockers became popular because ads kept getting more loud (both visually and audibly), in your face, and resource hungry (remember those flash ads that&#39;d keep your CPU pegged?).

Some of those descendants are very successful now and some descendants of slave owners are probably very poor now. And some people are descendants of both. And then I learn about the Jim Crow period, and then you hear that even the GI bill explicitly excluded black people, and lynchings into the 1950s, and the extremely hard fight the civil rights movement had, and even legal discrimination up to 1971, not to mention tons of possibly illegal but still very real discrimination after that. And then I think: you can&#39;t just stop doing a bad thing and pretend it didn&#39;t happen. You&#39;ve got to try to make things right. Have things been made right by now? I have no idea. I do know plenty of black people still live in fear of the police, and that when black people call the police, there&#39;s the non-zero chance that they&#39;re the ones who end up getting shot. Not to mention that many universities also have affirmative action for children of alumni, who are still predominantly white and rich, partially because of the legal discrimination uo to 1971, and partially because universities are ridiculously expensive. Has that affirmative action also been struck down? >; America is not in the least social-democratic, It used to be, though.

Right? I mean, I can get behind that. But then why the entire detour with race? Up until about 1971 (possibly later, but that&#39;s the date of <i>Loving vs Virginia</i> ), the US had formal, legal discrimination against black people. On finally removing that, there was at various times discussion of whether people who had been legally discriminated against all their lives should be compensated, as if they had been wronged in a tort sense. This would obviously be extremely expensive, and anyway impossible to quantify, so it never happened. Harvard, and many other colleges, has a big base of &quot;legacy&quot; admissions, as well as a certain amount of generational knowledge and connections - you&#39;re more likely to get into Harvard if your parents went to Harvard, over and above mere class status. Since black people were under-represented in this category, people came up with the idea of putting a thumb on the other side of the scale and artificially increasing their rate of admission. Can it balance exactly against the disadvantages of discrimination? No. >; I genuinely don&#39;t get why the race thing is part of the equation. Shouldn&#39;t this just be run-of-the-mill social democratic &quot;lets hand out some extra opportunities/benefits to the poor&quot; program?

Affirmative Action probably helped my father, whose father was a construction worker and mother a homemaker both of whom dropped out of high school, get into college and ultimately become a doctor. But because my father was a doctor, I had a fairly privileged upbringing. I&#39;m a generation removed, but growing up in California always had to indicate my background on standardized tests and always checked &quot;White&quot; for race and then &quot;Hispanic&quot; for ethnicity (which is how all the tests asked it in those days, not sure if it&#39;s still the case), without thinking much about it.

But it also feels totally irrelevant to me, personally, because of my upper class upbringing and elite education, and I feel like I&#39;ve never really been discriminated against. Though I possibly have been discriminated &quot;for&quot;, and benefited tremendously from it. So I don&#39;t know how I feel about this change. It&#39;s certainly a big one, but in the long run, maybe it&#39;s good?

And advertisement is the rich asking for more money. A man would be annoyed if he found himself in a mob of millionaires, all holding out their silk hats for a penny; or all shouting with one voice, “Give me money.” Yet advertisement does really assault the eye very much as such a shout would assault the ear. “Budge&#39;s Boots are the Best” simply means “Give me money”; “Use Seraphic Soap” simply means “Give me money.” It is a complete mistake to suppose that common people make our towns commonplace, with unsightly things like advertisements. Most of those whose wares are thus placarded everywhere are very wealthy gentlemen with coronets and country seats, men who are probably very particular about the artistic adornment of their own homes. They disfigure their towns in order to decorate their houses. — GK Chesterton, <i>The New Jersusalem</i> <a href="http://www.gkc.org.uk/gkc/books/GKC_New_Jerusalem.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.gkc.org.uk/gkc/books/GKC_New_Jerusalem.html</a> ]]>; Fri, 30 Jun 2023 16:11:03 +0000</span> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 lolinder https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 I block ads because they&#39;re psychological warfare that corporations wage against me.

They&#39;ll eagerly exploit a teenager&#39;s self-conscious body issues to sell useless beauty products.

It&#39;s because they&#39;ve become increasingly obnoxious. Nobody blocked ads when they were a simple column of links in the gutter or maybe an animated GIF banner with 3 frames. No, adblockers became popular because ads kept getting more loud (both visually and audibly), in your face, and resource hungry (remember those flash ads that&#39;d keep your CPU pegged?).

Some of those descendants are very successful now and some descendants of slave owners are probably very poor now. And some people are descendants of both. And then I learn about the Jim Crow period, and then you hear that even the GI bill explicitly excluded black people, and lynchings into the 1950s, and the extremely hard fight the civil rights movement had, and even legal discrimination up to 1971, not to mention tons of possibly illegal but still very real discrimination after that. And then I think: you can&#39;t just stop doing a bad thing and pretend it didn&#39;t happen. You&#39;ve got to try to make things right. Have things been made right by now? I have no idea. I do know plenty of black people still live in fear of the police, and that when black people call the police, there&#39;s the non-zero chance that they&#39;re the ones who end up getting shot. Not to mention that many universities also have affirmative action for children of alumni, who are still predominantly white and rich, partially because of the legal discrimination uo to 1971, and partially because universities are ridiculously expensive. Has that affirmative action also been struck down? >; America is not in the least social-democratic, It used to be, though.

Right? I mean, I can get behind that. But then why the entire detour with race? Up until about 1971 (possibly later, but that&#39;s the date of <i>Loving vs Virginia</i> ), the US had formal, legal discrimination against black people. On finally removing that, there was at various times discussion of whether people who had been legally discriminated against all their lives should be compensated, as if they had been wronged in a tort sense. This would obviously be extremely expensive, and anyway impossible to quantify, so it never happened. Harvard, and many other colleges, has a big base of &quot;legacy&quot; admissions, as well as a certain amount of generational knowledge and connections - you&#39;re more likely to get into Harvard if your parents went to Harvard, over and above mere class status. Since black people were under-represented in this category, people came up with the idea of putting a thumb on the other side of the scale and artificially increasing their rate of admission. Can it balance exactly against the disadvantages of discrimination? No. >; I genuinely don&#39;t get why the race thing is part of the equation. Shouldn&#39;t this just be run-of-the-mill social democratic &quot;lets hand out some extra opportunities/benefits to the poor&quot; program? America is not in the least social-democratic, but racism and anti-racism have been there since the beginning and will probably dominate US politics until the last person who remembers the KKK is dead.

Affirmative Action probably helped my father, whose father was a construction worker and mother a homemaker both of whom dropped out of high school, get into college and ultimately become a doctor. But because my father was a doctor, I had a fairly privileged upbringing. I&#39;m a generation removed, but growing up in California always had to indicate my background on standardized tests and always checked &quot;White&quot; for race and then &quot;Hispanic&quot; for ethnicity (which is how all the tests asked it in those days, not sure if it&#39;s still the case), without thinking much about it.

But it also feels totally irrelevant to me, personally, because of my upper class upbringing and elite education, and I feel like I&#39;ve never really been discriminated against. Though I possibly have been discriminated &quot;for&quot;, and benefited tremendously from it. So I don&#39;t know how I feel about this change. It&#39;s certainly a big one, but in the long run, maybe it&#39;s good?

And advertisement is the rich asking for more money. A man would be annoyed if he found himself in a mob of millionaires, all holding out their silk hats for a penny; or all shouting with one voice, “Give me money.” Yet advertisement does really assault the eye very much as such a shout would assault the ear. “Budge&#39;s Boots are the Best” simply means “Give me money”; “Use Seraphic Soap” simply means “Give me money.” It is a complete mistake to suppose that common people make our towns commonplace, with unsightly things like advertisements. Most of those whose wares are thus placarded everywhere are very wealthy gentlemen with coronets and country seats, men who are probably very particular about the artistic adornment of their own homes. They disfigure their towns in order to decorate their houses. — GK Chesterton, <i>The New Jersusalem</i> <a href="http://www.gkc.org.uk/gkc/books/GKC_New_Jerusalem.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.gkc.org.uk/gkc/books/GKC_New_Jerusalem.html</a> ]]>; Fri, 30 Jun 2023 16:11:03 +0000</span> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 lolinder https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 I block ads because they&#39;re psychological warfare that corporations wage against me. I don&#39;t care how unobtrusive the ads are. I don&#39;t care if the ads don&#39;t track me.

I have zero tolerance for ads of any sort. Advertisers have no morals, they&#39;re completely depraved. They&#39;ll eagerly exploit a teenager&#39;s self-conscious body issues to sell useless beauty products.

It&#39;s because they&#39;ve become increasingly obnoxious. Nobody blocked ads when they were a simple column of links in the gutter or maybe an animated GIF banner with 3 frames. No, adblockers became popular because ads kept getting more loud (both visually and audibly), in your face, and resource hungry (remember those flash ads that&#39;d keep your CPU pegged?).

Some of those descendants are very successful now and some descendants of slave owners are probably very poor now. And some people are descendants of both. And then I learn about the Jim Crow period, and then you hear that even the GI bill explicitly excluded black people, and lynchings into the 1950s, and the extremely hard fight the civil rights movement had, and even legal discrimination up to 1971, not to mention tons of possibly illegal but still very real discrimination after that. And then I think: you can&#39;t just stop doing a bad thing and pretend it didn&#39;t happen. You&#39;ve got to try to make things right. Have things been made right by now? I have no idea. I do know plenty of black people still live in fear of the police, and that when black people call the police, there&#39;s the non-zero chance that they&#39;re the ones who end up getting shot. Not to mention that many universities also have affirmative action for children of alumni, who are still predominantly white and rich, partially because of the legal discrimination uo to 1971, and partially because universities are ridiculously expensive. Has that affirmative action also been struck down? >; America is not in the least social-democratic, It used to be, though.

Right? I mean, I can get behind that. But then why the entire detour with race? Up until about 1971 (possibly later, but that&#39;s the date of <i>Loving vs Virginia</i> ), the US had formal, legal discrimination against black people. On finally removing that, there was at various times discussion of whether people who had been legally discriminated against all their lives should be compensated, as if they had been wronged in a tort sense. This would obviously be extremely expensive, and anyway impossible to quantify, so it never happened. Harvard, and many other colleges, has a big base of &quot;legacy&quot; admissions, as well as a certain amount of generational knowledge and connections - you&#39;re more likely to get into Harvard if your parents went to Harvard, over and above mere class status. Since black people were under-represented in this category, people came up with the idea of putting a thumb on the other side of the scale and artificially increasing their rate of admission. Can it balance exactly against the disadvantages of discrimination? No. >; I genuinely don&#39;t get why the race thing is part of the equation. Shouldn&#39;t this just be run-of-the-mill social democratic &quot;lets hand out some extra opportunities/benefits to the poor&quot; program? America is not in the least social-democratic, but racism and anti-racism have been there since the beginning and will probably dominate US politics until the last person who remembers the KKK is dead.

Affirmative Action probably helped my father, whose father was a construction worker and mother a homemaker both of whom dropped out of high school, get into college and ultimately become a doctor.

But it also feels totally irrelevant to me, personally, because of my upper class upbringing and elite education, and I feel like I&#39;ve never really been discriminated against. Though I possibly have been discriminated &quot;for&quot;, and benefited tremendously from it. So I don&#39;t know how I feel about this change. It&#39;s certainly a big one, but in the long run, maybe it&#39;s good?

And advertisement is the rich asking for more money. A man would be annoyed if he found himself in a mob of millionaires, all holding out their silk hats for a penny; or all shouting with one voice, “Give me money.” Yet advertisement does really assault the eye very much as such a shout would assault the ear. “Budge&#39;s Boots are the Best” simply means “Give me money”; “Use Seraphic Soap” simply means “Give me money.” It is a complete mistake to suppose that common people make our towns commonplace, with unsightly things like advertisements. Most of those whose wares are thus placarded everywhere are very wealthy gentlemen with coronets and country seats, men who are probably very particular about the artistic adornment of their own homes.

It&#39;s because they&#39;ve become increasingly obnoxious. Nobody blocked ads when they were a simple column of links in the gutter or maybe an animated GIF banner with 3 frames. No, adblockers became popular because ads kept getting more loud (both visually and audibly), in your face, and resource hungry (remember those flash ads that&#39;d keep your CPU pegged?).

Some of those descendants are very successful now and some descendants of slave owners are probably very poor now. And some people are descendants of both. And then I learn about the Jim Crow period, and then you hear that even the GI bill explicitly excluded black people, and lynchings into the 1950s, and the extremely hard fight the civil rights movement had, and even legal discrimination up to 1971, not to mention tons of possibly illegal but still very real discrimination after that. And then I think: you can&#39;t just stop doing a bad thing and pretend it didn&#39;t happen. You&#39;ve got to try to make things right. Have things been made right by now? I have no idea. I do know plenty of black people still live in fear of the police, and that when black people call the police, there&#39;s the non-zero chance that they&#39;re the ones who end up getting shot. Not to mention that many universities also have affirmative action for children of alumni, who are still predominantly white and rich, partially because of the legal discrimination uo to 1971, and partially because universities are ridiculously expensive. Has that affirmative action also been struck down? >; America is not in the least social-democratic, It used to be, though.

Right? I mean, I can get behind that. But then why the entire detour with race? Up until about 1971 (possibly later, but that&#39;s the date of <i>Loving vs Virginia</i> ), the US had formal, legal discrimination against black people. On finally removing that, there was at various times discussion of whether people who had been legally discriminated against all their lives should be compensated, as if they had been wronged in a tort sense. This would obviously be extremely expensive, and anyway impossible to quantify, so it never happened. Harvard, and many other colleges, has a big base of &quot;legacy&quot; admissions, as well as a certain amount of generational knowledge and connections - you&#39;re more likely to get into Harvard if your parents went to Harvard, over and above mere class status. Since black people were under-represented in this category, people came up with the idea of putting a thumb on the other side of the scale and artificially increasing their rate of admission. Can it balance exactly against the disadvantages of discrimination? No. >; I genuinely don&#39;t get why the race thing is part of the equation. Shouldn&#39;t this just be run-of-the-mill social democratic &quot;lets hand out some extra opportunities/benefits to the poor&quot; program?

Affirmative Action probably helped my father, whose father was a construction worker and mother a homemaker both of whom dropped out of high school, get into college and ultimately become a doctor. But because my father was a doctor, I had a fairly privileged upbringing. I&#39;m a generation removed, but growing up in California always had to indicate my background on standardized tests and always checked &quot;White&quot; for race and then &quot;Hispanic&quot; for ethnicity (which is how all the tests asked it in those days, not sure if it&#39;s still the case), without thinking much about it.

But it also feels totally irrelevant to me, personally, because of my upper class upbringing and elite education, and I feel like I&#39;ve never really been discriminated against. Though I possibly have been discriminated &quot;for&quot;, and benefited tremendously from it. So I don&#39;t know how I feel about this change. It&#39;s certainly a big one, but in the long run, maybe it&#39;s good?

And advertisement is the rich asking for more money. A man would be annoyed if he found himself in a mob of millionaires, all holding out their silk hats for a penny; or all shouting with one voice, “Give me money.” Yet advertisement does really assault the eye very much as such a shout would assault the ear. “Budge&#39;s Boots are the Best” simply means “Give me money”; “Use Seraphic Soap” simply means “Give me money.” It is a complete mistake to suppose that common people make our towns commonplace, with unsightly things like advertisements. Most of those whose wares are thus placarded everywhere are very wealthy gentlemen with coronets and country seats, men who are probably very particular about the artistic adornment of their own homes. They disfigure their towns in order to decorate their houses. — GK Chesterton, <i>The New Jersusalem</i> <a href="http://www.gkc.org.uk/gkc/books/GKC_New_Jerusalem.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.gkc.org.uk/gkc/books/GKC_New_Jerusalem.html</a> ]]>; Fri, 30 Jun 2023 16:11:03 +0000</span> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 lolinder https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 I block ads because they&#39;re psychological warfare that corporations wage against me.

I have zero tolerance for ads of any sort. Advertisers have no morals, they&#39;re completely depraved. They&#39;ll eagerly exploit a teenager&#39;s self-conscious body issues to sell useless beauty products.

It&#39;s because they&#39;ve become increasingly obnoxious. Nobody blocked ads when they were a simple column of links in the gutter or maybe an animated GIF banner with 3 frames. No, adblockers became popular because ads kept getting more loud (both visually and audibly), in your face, and resource hungry (remember those flash ads that&#39;d keep your CPU pegged?).

Some of those descendants are very successful now and some descendants of slave owners are probably very poor now. And some people are descendants of both. And then I learn about the Jim Crow period, and then you hear that even the GI bill explicitly excluded black people, and lynchings into the 1950s, and the extremely hard fight the civil rights movement had, and even legal discrimination up to 1971, not to mention tons of possibly illegal but still very real discrimination after that. And then I think: you can&#39;t just stop doing a bad thing and pretend it didn&#39;t happen. You&#39;ve got to try to make things right. Have things been made right by now? I have no idea. I do know plenty of black people still live in fear of the police, and that when black people call the police, there&#39;s the non-zero chance that they&#39;re the ones who end up getting shot. Not to mention that many universities also have affirmative action for children of alumni, who are still predominantly white and rich, partially because of the legal discrimination uo to 1971, and partially because universities are ridiculously expensive. Has that affirmative action also been struck down? >; America is not in the least social-democratic, It used to be, though.

Right? I mean, I can get behind that. But then why the entire detour with race? Up until about 1971 (possibly later, but that&#39;s the date of <i>Loving vs Virginia</i> ), the US had formal, legal discrimination against black people. On finally removing that, there was at various times discussion of whether people who had been legally discriminated against all their lives should be compensated, as if they had been wronged in a tort sense. This would obviously be extremely expensive, and anyway impossible to quantify, so it never happened. Harvard, and many other colleges, has a big base of &quot;legacy&quot; admissions, as well as a certain amount of generational knowledge and connections - you&#39;re more likely to get into Harvard if your parents went to Harvard, over and above mere class status. Since black people were under-represented in this category, people came up with the idea of putting a thumb on the other side of the scale and artificially increasing their rate of admission. Can it balance exactly against the disadvantages of discrimination? No. >; I genuinely don&#39;t get why the race thing is part of the equation. Shouldn&#39;t this just be run-of-the-mill social democratic &quot;lets hand out some extra opportunities/benefits to the poor&quot; program? America is not in the least social-democratic, but racism and anti-racism have been there since the beginning and will probably dominate US politics until the last person who remembers the KKK is dead.

Affirmative Action probably helped my father, whose father was a construction worker and mother a homemaker both of whom dropped out of high school, get into college and ultimately become a doctor. But because my father was a doctor, I had a fairly privileged upbringing. I&#39;m a generation removed, but growing up in California always had to indicate my background on standardized tests and always checked &quot;White&quot; for race and then &quot;Hispanic&quot; for ethnicity (which is how all the tests asked it in those days, not sure if it&#39;s still the case), without thinking much about it.

But it also feels totally irrelevant to me, personally, because of my upper class upbringing and elite education, and I feel like I&#39;ve never really been discriminated against. Though I possibly have been discriminated &quot;for&quot;, and benefited tremendously from it. So I don&#39;t know how I feel about this change. It&#39;s certainly a big one, but in the long run, maybe it&#39;s good?

And advertisement is the rich asking for more money. A man would be annoyed if he found himself in a mob of millionaires, all holding out their silk hats for a penny; or all shouting with one voice, “Give me money.” Yet advertisement does really assault the eye very much as such a shout would assault the ear. “Budge&#39;s Boots are the Best” simply means “Give me money”; “Use Seraphic Soap” simply means “Give me money.” It is a complete mistake to suppose that common people make our towns commonplace, with unsightly things like advertisements. Most of those whose wares are thus placarded everywhere are very wealthy gentlemen with coronets and country seats, men who are probably very particular about the artistic adornment of their own homes. They disfigure their towns in order to decorate their houses. — GK Chesterton, <i>The New Jersusalem</i> <a href="http://www.gkc.org.uk/gkc/books/GKC_New_Jerusalem.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.gkc.org.uk/gkc/books/GKC_New_Jerusalem.html</a> ]]>; Fri, 30 Jun 2023 16:11:03 +0000</span> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 lolinder https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 I block ads because they&#39;re psychological warfare that corporations wage against me. I don&#39;t care how unobtrusive the ads are. I don&#39;t care if the ads don&#39;t track me.

I have zero tolerance for ads of any sort. Advertisers have no morals, they&#39;re completely depraved. They&#39;ll eagerly exploit a teenager&#39;s self-conscious body issues to sell useless beauty products.

It&#39;s because they&#39;ve become increasingly obnoxious. Nobody blocked ads when they were a simple column of links in the gutter or maybe an animated GIF banner with 3 frames. No, adblockers became popular because ads kept getting more loud (both visually and audibly), in your face, and resource hungry (remember those flash ads that&#39;d keep your CPU pegged?).

Some of those descendants are very successful now and some descendants of slave owners are probably very poor now. And some people are descendants of both. And then I learn about the Jim Crow period, and then you hear that even the GI bill explicitly excluded black people, and lynchings into the 1950s, and the extremely hard fight the civil rights movement had, and even legal discrimination up to 1971, not to mention tons of possibly illegal but still very real discrimination after that. And then I think: you can&#39;t just stop doing a bad thing and pretend it didn&#39;t happen. You&#39;ve got to try to make things right. Have things been made right by now? I have no idea. I do know plenty of black people still live in fear of the police, and that when black people call the police, there&#39;s the non-zero chance that they&#39;re the ones who end up getting shot. Not to mention that many universities also have affirmative action for children of alumni, who are still predominantly white and rich, partially because of the legal discrimination uo to 1971, and partially because universities are ridiculously expensive. Has that affirmative action also been struck down? >; America is not in the least social-democratic, It used to be, though.

Right? I mean, I can get behind that. But then why the entire detour with race? Up until about 1971 (possibly later, but that&#39;s the date of <i>Loving vs Virginia</i> ), the US had formal, legal discrimination against black people. On finally removing that, there was at various times discussion of whether people who had been legally discriminated against all their lives should be compensated, as if they had been wronged in a tort sense. This would obviously be extremely expensive, and anyway impossible to quantify, so it never happened. Harvard, and many other colleges, has a big base of &quot;legacy&quot; admissions, as well as a certain amount of generational knowledge and connections - you&#39;re more likely to get into Harvard if your parents went to Harvard, over and above mere class status. Since black people were under-represented in this category, people came up with the idea of putting a thumb on the other side of the scale and artificially increasing their rate of admission. Can it balance exactly against the disadvantages of discrimination? No. >; I genuinely don&#39;t get why the race thing is part of the equation. Shouldn&#39;t this just be run-of-the-mill social democratic &quot;lets hand out some extra opportunities/benefits to the poor&quot; program? America is not in the least social-democratic, but racism and anti-racism have been there since the beginning and will probably dominate US politics until the last person who remembers the KKK is dead.

Affirmative Action probably helped my father, whose father was a construction worker and mother a homemaker both of whom dropped out of high school, get into college and ultimately become a doctor.

But it also feels totally irrelevant to me, personally, because of my upper class upbringing and elite education, and I feel like I&#39;ve never really been discriminated against. Though I possibly have been discriminated &quot;for&quot;, and benefited tremendously from it. So I don&#39;t know how I feel about this change. It&#39;s certainly a big one, but in the long run, maybe it&#39;s good?

And advertisement is the rich asking for more money. A man would be annoyed if he found himself in a mob of millionaires, all holding out their silk hats for a penny; or all shouting with one voice, “Give me money.” Yet advertisement does really assault the eye very much as such a shout would assault the ear. “Budge&#39;s Boots are the Best” simply means “Give me money”; “Use Seraphic Soap” simply means “Give me money.” It is a complete mistake to suppose that common people make our towns commonplace, with unsightly things like advertisements. Most of those whose wares are thus placarded everywhere are very wealthy gentlemen with coronets and country seats, men who are probably very particular about the artistic adornment of their own homes.

It&#39;s because they&#39;ve become increasingly obnoxious. Nobody blocked ads when they were a simple column of links in the gutter or maybe an animated GIF banner with 3 frames. No, adblockers became popular because ads kept getting more loud (both visually and audibly), in your face, and resource hungry (remember those flash ads that&#39;d keep your CPU pegged?).

Some of those descendants are very successful now and some descendants of slave owners are probably very poor now. And some people are descendants of both. And then I learn about the Jim Crow period, and then you hear that even the GI bill explicitly excluded black people, and lynchings into the 1950s, and the extremely hard fight the civil rights movement had, and even legal discrimination up to 1971, not to mention tons of possibly illegal but still very real discrimination after that. And then I think: you can&#39;t just stop doing a bad thing and pretend it didn&#39;t happen. You&#39;ve got to try to make things right. Have things been made right by now? I have no idea. I do know plenty of black people still live in fear of the police, and that when black people call the police, there&#39;s the non-zero chance that they&#39;re the ones who end up getting shot. Not to mention that many universities also have affirmative action for children of alumni, who are still predominantly white and rich, partially because of the legal discrimination uo to 1971, and partially because universities are ridiculously expensive. Has that affirmative action also been struck down? >; America is not in the least social-democratic, It used to be, though.

Right? I mean, I can get behind that. But then why the entire detour with race? Up until about 1971 (possibly later, but that&#39;s the date of <i>Loving vs Virginia</i> ), the US had formal, legal discrimination against black people. On finally removing that, there was at various times discussion of whether people who had been legally discriminated against all their lives should be compensated, as if they had been wronged in a tort sense. This would obviously be extremely expensive, and anyway impossible to quantify, so it never happened. Harvard, and many other colleges, has a big base of &quot;legacy&quot; admissions, as well as a certain amount of generational knowledge and connections - you&#39;re more likely to get into Harvard if your parents went to Harvard, over and above mere class status. Since black people were under-represented in this category, people came up with the idea of putting a thumb on the other side of the scale and artificially increasing their rate of admission. Can it balance exactly against the disadvantages of discrimination? No. >; I genuinely don&#39;t get why the race thing is part of the equation. Shouldn&#39;t this just be run-of-the-mill social democratic &quot;lets hand out some extra opportunities/benefits to the poor&quot; program?

Affirmative Action probably helped my father, whose father was a construction worker and mother a homemaker both of whom dropped out of high school, get into college and ultimately become a doctor.

But it also feels totally irrelevant to me, personally, because of my upper class upbringing and elite education, and I feel like I&#39;ve never really been discriminated against. Though I possibly have been discriminated &quot;for&quot;, and benefited tremendously from it. So I don&#39;t know how I feel about this change. It&#39;s certainly a big one, but in the long run, maybe it&#39;s good?

And advertisement is the rich asking for more money. A man would be annoyed if he found himself in a mob of millionaires, all holding out their silk hats for a penny; or all shouting with one voice, “Give me money.” Yet advertisement does really assault the eye very much as such a shout would assault the ear. “Budge&#39;s Boots are the Best” simply means “Give me money”; “Use Seraphic Soap” simply means “Give me money.” It is a complete mistake to suppose that common people make our towns commonplace, with unsightly things like advertisements. Most of those whose wares are thus placarded everywhere are very wealthy gentlemen with coronets and country seats, men who are probably very particular about the artistic adornment of their own homes.

It&#39;s because they&#39;ve become increasingly obnoxious. Nobody blocked ads when they were a simple column of links in the gutter or maybe an animated GIF banner with 3 frames. No, adblockers became popular because ads kept getting more loud (both visually and audibly), in your face, and resource hungry (remember those flash ads that&#39;d keep your CPU pegged?).

Some of those descendants are very successful now and some descendants of slave owners are probably very poor now. And some people are descendants of both. And then I learn about the Jim Crow period, and then you hear that even the GI bill explicitly excluded black people, and lynchings into the 1950s, and the extremely hard fight the civil rights movement had, and even legal discrimination up to 1971, not to mention tons of possibly illegal but still very real discrimination after that. And then I think: you can&#39;t just stop doing a bad thing and pretend it didn&#39;t happen. You&#39;ve got to try to make things right. Have things been made right by now? I have no idea. I do know plenty of black people still live in fear of the police, and that when black people call the police, there&#39;s the non-zero chance that they&#39;re the ones who end up getting shot. Not to mention that many universities also have affirmative action for children of alumni, who are still predominantly white and rich, partially because of the legal discrimination uo to 1971, and partially because universities are ridiculously expensive. Has that affirmative action also been struck down? >; America is not in the least social-democratic, It used to be, though.

Right? I mean, I can get behind that. But then why the entire detour with race? Up until about 1971 (possibly later, but that&#39;s the date of <i>Loving vs Virginia</i> ), the US had formal, legal discrimination against black people. On finally removing that, there was at various times discussion of whether people who had been legally discriminated against all their lives should be compensated, as if they had been wronged in a tort sense. This would obviously be extremely expensive, and anyway impossible to quantify, so it never happened. Harvard, and many other colleges, has a big base of &quot;legacy&quot; admissions, as well as a certain amount of generational knowledge and connections - you&#39;re more likely to get into Harvard if your parents went to Harvard, over and above mere class status. Since black people were under-represented in this category, people came up with the idea of putting a thumb on the other side of the scale and artificially increasing their rate of admission. Can it balance exactly against the disadvantages of discrimination? No. >; I genuinely don&#39;t get why the race thing is part of the equation. Shouldn&#39;t this just be run-of-the-mill social democratic &quot;lets hand out some extra opportunities/benefits to the poor&quot; program? America is not in the least social-democratic, but racism and anti-racism have been there since the beginning and will probably dominate US politics until the last person who remembers the KKK is dead.

But it also feels totally irrelevant to me, personally, because of my upper class upbringing and elite education, and I feel like I&#39;ve never really been discriminated against. Though I possibly have been discriminated &quot;for&quot;, and benefited tremendously from it. So I don&#39;t know how I feel about this change. It&#39;s certainly a big one, but in the long run, maybe it&#39;s good?

And advertisement is the rich asking for more money. A man would be annoyed if he found himself in a mob of millionaires, all holding out their silk hats for a penny; or all shouting with one voice, “Give me money.” Yet advertisement does really assault the eye very much as such a shout would assault the ear. “Budge&#39;s Boots are the Best” simply means “Give me money”; “Use Seraphic Soap” simply means “Give me money.” It is a complete mistake to suppose that common people make our towns commonplace, with unsightly things like advertisements. Most of those whose wares are thus placarded everywhere are very wealthy gentlemen with coronets and country seats, men who are probably very particular about the artistic adornment of their own homes.

It&#39;s because they&#39;ve become increasingly obnoxious. Nobody blocked ads when they were a simple column of links in the gutter or maybe an animated GIF banner with 3 frames. No, adblockers became popular because ads kept getting more loud (both visually and audibly), in your face, and resource hungry (remember those flash ads that&#39;d keep your CPU pegged?).

Some of those descendants are very successful now and some descendants of slave owners are probably very poor now. And some people are descendants of both. And then I learn about the Jim Crow period, and then you hear that even the GI bill explicitly excluded black people, and lynchings into the 1950s, and the extremely hard fight the civil rights movement had, and even legal discrimination up to 1971, not to mention tons of possibly illegal but still very real discrimination after that. And then I think: you can&#39;t just stop doing a bad thing and pretend it didn&#39;t happen. You&#39;ve got to try to make things right. Have things been made right by now? I have no idea. I do know plenty of black people still live in fear of the police, and that when black people call the police, there&#39;s the non-zero chance that they&#39;re the ones who end up getting shot. Not to mention that many universities also have affirmative action for children of alumni, who are still predominantly white and rich, partially because of the legal discrimination uo to 1971, and partially because universities are ridiculously expensive. Has that affirmative action also been struck down? >; America is not in the least social-democratic, It used to be, though.

Right? I mean, I can get behind that. But then why the entire detour with race? Up until about 1971 (possibly later, but that&#39;s the date of <i>Loving vs Virginia</i> ), the US had formal, legal discrimination against black people. On finally removing that, there was at various times discussion of whether people who had been legally discriminated against all their lives should be compensated, as if they had been wronged in a tort sense. This would obviously be extremely expensive, and anyway impossible to quantify, so it never happened. Harvard, and many other colleges, has a big base of &quot;legacy&quot; admissions, as well as a certain amount of generational knowledge and connections - you&#39;re more likely to get into Harvard if your parents went to Harvard, over and above mere class status. Since black people were under-represented in this category, people came up with the idea of putting a thumb on the other side of the scale and artificially increasing their rate of admission. Can it balance exactly against the disadvantages of discrimination? No. >; I genuinely don&#39;t get why the race thing is part of the equation. Shouldn&#39;t this just be run-of-the-mill social democratic &quot;lets hand out some extra opportunities/benefits to the poor&quot; program? America is not in the least social-democratic, but racism and anti-racism have been there since the beginning and will probably dominate US politics until the last person who remembers the KKK is dead.

Affirmative Action probably helped my father, whose father was a construction worker and mother a homemaker both of whom dropped out of high school, get into college and ultimately become a doctor. But because my father was a doctor, I had a fairly privileged upbringing. I&#39;m a generation removed, but growing up in California always had to indicate my background on standardized tests and always checked &quot;White&quot; for race and then &quot;Hispanic&quot; for ethnicity (which is how all the tests asked it in those days, not sure if it&#39;s still the case), without thinking much about it. I went to MIT, and to this day I wonder how much checking &quot;Hispanic&quot; helped me there and if I &quot;deserved&quot; to go.

I&#39;ve always had an identity crisis about what I am. I know in the current zeitgeist there&#39;s a big push for racial justice, of which being Hispanic and &quot;brown&quot; is a part. But it also feels totally irrelevant to me, personally, because of my upper class upbringing and elite education, and I feel like I&#39;ve never really been discriminated against. Though I possibly have been discriminated &quot;for&quot;, and benefited tremendously from it. So I don&#39;t know how I feel about this change. It&#39;s certainly a big one, but in the long run, maybe it&#39;s good? I know I&#39;ve always wondered if being Hispanic helped me get into college or into jobs, but the flip side is that other people must wonder the same... ]]>; Thu, 29 Jun 2023 14:40:31 +0000</span> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36520992 losvedir https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36520992 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36520992 I don&#39;t buy this.

And advertisement is the rich asking for more money. A man would be annoyed if he found himself in a mob of millionaires, all holding out their silk hats for a penny; or all shouting with one voice, “Give me money.” Yet advertisement does really assault the eye very much as such a shout would assault the ear. “Budge&#39;s Boots are the Best” simply means “Give me money”; “Use Seraphic Soap” simply means “Give me money.” It is a complete mistake to suppose that common people make our towns commonplace, with unsightly things like advertisements. Most of those whose wares are thus placarded everywhere are very wealthy gentlemen with coronets and country seats, men who are probably very particular about the artistic adornment of their own homes. They disfigure their towns in order to decorate their houses. — GK Chesterton, <i>The New Jersusalem</i> <a href="http://www.gkc.org.uk/gkc/books/GKC_New_Jerusalem.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.gkc.org.uk/gkc/books/GKC_New_Jerusalem.html</a> ]]>; Fri, 30 Jun 2023 16:11:03 +0000</span> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 lolinder https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 I block ads because they&#39;re psychological warfare that corporations wage against me. I don&#39;t care how unobtrusive the ads are. I don&#39;t care if the ads don&#39;t track me. I grew up changing the channel on TV when ads came on, and ripping adverts out of magazines before sitting down to read them. I vote for billboard bans whenever I can. I have zero tolerance for ads of any sort. Advertisers have no morals, they&#39;re completely depraved. They&#39;ll eagerly exploit a teenager&#39;s self-conscious body issues to sell useless beauty products. They sell sugar water to fat people and at every turn promote the rampant consumerist culture that is destroying our planet.

It&#39;s because they&#39;ve become increasingly obnoxious. Nobody blocked ads when they were a simple column of links in the gutter or maybe an animated GIF banner with 3 frames. No, adblockers became popular because ads kept getting more loud (both visually and audibly), in your face, and resource hungry (remember those flash ads that&#39;d keep your CPU pegged?).

Some of those descendants are very successful now and some descendants of slave owners are probably very poor now. And some people are descendants of both. And then I learn about the Jim Crow period, and then you hear that even the GI bill explicitly excluded black people, and lynchings into the 1950s, and the extremely hard fight the civil rights movement had, and even legal discrimination up to 1971, not to mention tons of possibly illegal but still very real discrimination after that. And then I think: you can&#39;t just stop doing a bad thing and pretend it didn&#39;t happen. You&#39;ve got to try to make things right. Have things been made right by now? I have no idea. I do know plenty of black people still live in fear of the police, and that when black people call the police, there&#39;s the non-zero chance that they&#39;re the ones who end up getting shot. Not to mention that many universities also have affirmative action for children of alumni, who are still predominantly white and rich, partially because of the legal discrimination uo to 1971, and partially because universities are ridiculously expensive. Has that affirmative action also been struck down? >; America is not in the least social-democratic, It used to be, though.

Right? I mean, I can get behind that. But then why the entire detour with race? Up until about 1971 (possibly later, but that&#39;s the date of <i>Loving vs Virginia</i> ), the US had formal, legal discrimination against black people. On finally removing that, there was at various times discussion of whether people who had been legally discriminated against all their lives should be compensated, as if they had been wronged in a tort sense. This would obviously be extremely expensive, and anyway impossible to quantify, so it never happened. Harvard, and many other colleges, has a big base of &quot;legacy&quot; admissions, as well as a certain amount of generational knowledge and connections - you&#39;re more likely to get into Harvard if your parents went to Harvard, over and above mere class status. Since black people were under-represented in this category, people came up with the idea of putting a thumb on the other side of the scale and artificially increasing their rate of admission. Can it balance exactly against the disadvantages of discrimination? No. >; I genuinely don&#39;t get why the race thing is part of the equation. Shouldn&#39;t this just be run-of-the-mill social democratic &quot;lets hand out some extra opportunities/benefits to the poor&quot; program?

Affirmative Action probably helped my father, whose father was a construction worker and mother a homemaker both of whom dropped out of high school, get into college and ultimately become a doctor.

But it also feels totally irrelevant to me, personally, because of my upper class upbringing and elite education, and I feel like I&#39;ve never really been discriminated against. Though I possibly have been discriminated &quot;for&quot;, and benefited tremendously from it. So I don&#39;t know how I feel about this change. It&#39;s certainly a big one, but in the long run, maybe it&#39;s good?

And advertisement is the rich asking for more money. A man would be annoyed if he found himself in a mob of millionaires, all holding out their silk hats for a penny; or all shouting with one voice, “Give me money.” Yet advertisement does really assault the eye very much as such a shout would assault the ear. “Budge&#39;s Boots are the Best” simply means “Give me money”; “Use Seraphic Soap” simply means “Give me money.” It is a complete mistake to suppose that common people make our towns commonplace, with unsightly things like advertisements. Most of those whose wares are thus placarded everywhere are very wealthy gentlemen with coronets and country seats, men who are probably very particular about the artistic adornment of their own homes.

It&#39;s because they&#39;ve become increasingly obnoxious. Nobody blocked ads when they were a simple column of links in the gutter or maybe an animated GIF banner with 3 frames. No, adblockers became popular because ads kept getting more loud (both visually and audibly), in your face, and resource hungry (remember those flash ads that&#39;d keep your CPU pegged?).

Some of those descendants are very successful now and some descendants of slave owners are probably very poor now. And some people are descendants of both. And then I learn about the Jim Crow period, and then you hear that even the GI bill explicitly excluded black people, and lynchings into the 1950s, and the extremely hard fight the civil rights movement had, and even legal discrimination up to 1971, not to mention tons of possibly illegal but still very real discrimination after that. And then I think: you can&#39;t just stop doing a bad thing and pretend it didn&#39;t happen. You&#39;ve got to try to make things right. Have things been made right by now? I have no idea. I do know plenty of black people still live in fear of the police, and that when black people call the police, there&#39;s the non-zero chance that they&#39;re the ones who end up getting shot. Not to mention that many universities also have affirmative action for children of alumni, who are still predominantly white and rich, partially because of the legal discrimination uo to 1971, and partially because universities are ridiculously expensive. Has that affirmative action also been struck down? >; America is not in the least social-democratic, It used to be, though.

Right? I mean, I can get behind that. But then why the entire detour with race? Up until about 1971 (possibly later, but that&#39;s the date of <i>Loving vs Virginia</i> ), the US had formal, legal discrimination against black people. On finally removing that, there was at various times discussion of whether people who had been legally discriminated against all their lives should be compensated, as if they had been wronged in a tort sense. This would obviously be extremely expensive, and anyway impossible to quantify, so it never happened. Harvard, and many other colleges, has a big base of &quot;legacy&quot; admissions, as well as a certain amount of generational knowledge and connections - you&#39;re more likely to get into Harvard if your parents went to Harvard, over and above mere class status. Since black people were under-represented in this category, people came up with the idea of putting a thumb on the other side of the scale and artificially increasing their rate of admission. Can it balance exactly against the disadvantages of discrimination? No. >; I genuinely don&#39;t get why the race thing is part of the equation. Shouldn&#39;t this just be run-of-the-mill social democratic &quot;lets hand out some extra opportunities/benefits to the poor&quot; program?

Affirmative Action probably helped my father, whose father was a construction worker and mother a homemaker both of whom dropped out of high school, get into college and ultimately become a doctor.

But it also feels totally irrelevant to me, personally, because of my upper class upbringing and elite education, and I feel like I&#39;ve never really been discriminated against. Though I possibly have been discriminated &quot;for&quot;, and benefited tremendously from it. So I don&#39;t know how I feel about this change. It&#39;s certainly a big one, but in the long run, maybe it&#39;s good?

And advertisement is the rich asking for more money. A man would be annoyed if he found himself in a mob of millionaires, all holding out their silk hats for a penny; or all shouting with one voice, “Give me money.” Yet advertisement does really assault the eye very much as such a shout would assault the ear. “Budge&#39;s Boots are the Best” simply means “Give me money”; “Use Seraphic Soap” simply means “Give me money.” It is a complete mistake to suppose that common people make our towns commonplace, with unsightly things like advertisements. Most of those whose wares are thus placarded everywhere are very wealthy gentlemen with coronets and country seats, men who are probably very particular about the artistic adornment of their own homes.

It&#39;s because they&#39;ve become increasingly obnoxious. Nobody blocked ads when they were a simple column of links in the gutter or maybe an animated GIF banner with 3 frames. No, adblockers became popular because ads kept getting more loud (both visually and audibly), in your face, and resource hungry (remember those flash ads that&#39;d keep your CPU pegged?).

Some of those descendants are very successful now and some descendants of slave owners are probably very poor now. And some people are descendants of both. And then I learn about the Jim Crow period, and then you hear that even the GI bill explicitly excluded black people, and lynchings into the 1950s, and the extremely hard fight the civil rights movement had, and even legal discrimination up to 1971, not to mention tons of possibly illegal but still very real discrimination after that. And then I think: you can&#39;t just stop doing a bad thing and pretend it didn&#39;t happen. You&#39;ve got to try to make things right. Have things been made right by now? I have no idea. I do know plenty of black people still live in fear of the police, and that when black people call the police, there&#39;s the non-zero chance that they&#39;re the ones who end up getting shot. Not to mention that many universities also have affirmative action for children of alumni, who are still predominantly white and rich, partially because of the legal discrimination uo to 1971, and partially because universities are ridiculously expensive. Has that affirmative action also been struck down? >; America is not in the least social-democratic, It used to be, though.

Right? I mean, I can get behind that. But then why the entire detour with race? Up until about 1971 (possibly later, but that&#39;s the date of <i>Loving vs Virginia</i> ), the US had formal, legal discrimination against black people. On finally removing that, there was at various times discussion of whether people who had been legally discriminated against all their lives should be compensated, as if they had been wronged in a tort sense. This would obviously be extremely expensive, and anyway impossible to quantify, so it never happened. Harvard, and many other colleges, has a big base of &quot;legacy&quot; admissions, as well as a certain amount of generational knowledge and connections - you&#39;re more likely to get into Harvard if your parents went to Harvard, over and above mere class status. Since black people were under-represented in this category, people came up with the idea of putting a thumb on the other side of the scale and artificially increasing their rate of admission. Can it balance exactly against the disadvantages of discrimination? No. >; I genuinely don&#39;t get why the race thing is part of the equation. Shouldn&#39;t this just be run-of-the-mill social democratic &quot;lets hand out some extra opportunities/benefits to the poor&quot; program? America is not in the least social-democratic, but racism and anti-racism have been there since the beginning and will probably dominate US politics until the last person who remembers the KKK is dead.

But it also feels totally irrelevant to me, personally, because of my upper class upbringing and elite education, and I feel like I&#39;ve never really been discriminated against. Though I possibly have been discriminated &quot;for&quot;, and benefited tremendously from it. So I don&#39;t know how I feel about this change. It&#39;s certainly a big one, but in the long run, maybe it&#39;s good?

And advertisement is the rich asking for more money. A man would be annoyed if he found himself in a mob of millionaires, all holding out their silk hats for a penny; or all shouting with one voice, “Give me money.” Yet advertisement does really assault the eye very much as such a shout would assault the ear. “Budge&#39;s Boots are the Best” simply means “Give me money”; “Use Seraphic Soap” simply means “Give me money.” It is a complete mistake to suppose that common people make our towns commonplace, with unsightly things like advertisements. Most of those whose wares are thus placarded everywhere are very wealthy gentlemen with coronets and country seats, men who are probably very particular about the artistic adornment of their own homes.

It&#39;s because they&#39;ve become increasingly obnoxious. Nobody blocked ads when they were a simple column of links in the gutter or maybe an animated GIF banner with 3 frames. No, adblockers became popular because ads kept getting more loud (both visually and audibly), in your face, and resource hungry (remember those flash ads that&#39;d keep your CPU pegged?).

Some of those descendants are very successful now and some descendants of slave owners are probably very poor now. And some people are descendants of both. And then I learn about the Jim Crow period, and then you hear that even the GI bill explicitly excluded black people, and lynchings into the 1950s, and the extremely hard fight the civil rights movement had, and even legal discrimination up to 1971, not to mention tons of possibly illegal but still very real discrimination after that. And then I think: you can&#39;t just stop doing a bad thing and pretend it didn&#39;t happen. You&#39;ve got to try to make things right. Have things been made right by now? I have no idea. I do know plenty of black people still live in fear of the police, and that when black people call the police, there&#39;s the non-zero chance that they&#39;re the ones who end up getting shot. Not to mention that many universities also have affirmative action for children of alumni, who are still predominantly white and rich, partially because of the legal discrimination uo to 1971, and partially because universities are ridiculously expensive. Has that affirmative action also been struck down? >; America is not in the least social-democratic, It used to be, though.

Right? I mean, I can get behind that. But then why the entire detour with race? Up until about 1971 (possibly later, but that&#39;s the date of <i>Loving vs Virginia</i> ), the US had formal, legal discrimination against black people. On finally removing that, there was at various times discussion of whether people who had been legally discriminated against all their lives should be compensated, as if they had been wronged in a tort sense. This would obviously be extremely expensive, and anyway impossible to quantify, so it never happened. Harvard, and many other colleges, has a big base of &quot;legacy&quot; admissions, as well as a certain amount of generational knowledge and connections - you&#39;re more likely to get into Harvard if your parents went to Harvard, over and above mere class status. Since black people were under-represented in this category, people came up with the idea of putting a thumb on the other side of the scale and artificially increasing their rate of admission. Can it balance exactly against the disadvantages of discrimination? No. >; I genuinely don&#39;t get why the race thing is part of the equation. Shouldn&#39;t this just be run-of-the-mill social democratic &quot;lets hand out some extra opportunities/benefits to the poor&quot; program? America is not in the least social-democratic, but racism and anti-racism have been there since the beginning and will probably dominate US politics until the last person who remembers the KKK is dead.

Affirmative Action probably helped my father, whose father was a construction worker and mother a homemaker both of whom dropped out of high school, get into college and ultimately become a doctor. But because my father was a doctor, I had a fairly privileged upbringing. I&#39;m a generation removed, but growing up in California always had to indicate my background on standardized tests and always checked &quot;White&quot; for race and then &quot;Hispanic&quot; for ethnicity (which is how all the tests asked it in those days, not sure if it&#39;s still the case), without thinking much about it. I went to MIT, and to this day I wonder how much checking &quot;Hispanic&quot; helped me there and if I &quot;deserved&quot; to go.

I&#39;ve always had an identity crisis about what I am. I know in the current zeitgeist there&#39;s a big push for racial justice, of which being Hispanic and &quot;brown&quot; is a part. But it also feels totally irrelevant to me, personally, because of my upper class upbringing and elite education, and I feel like I&#39;ve never really been discriminated against. Though I possibly have been discriminated &quot;for&quot;, and benefited tremendously from it. So I don&#39;t know how I feel about this change. It&#39;s certainly a big one, but in the long run, maybe it&#39;s good? I know I&#39;ve always wondered if being Hispanic helped me get into college or into jobs, but the flip side is that other people must wonder the same... ]]>; Thu, 29 Jun 2023 14:40:31 +0000</span> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36520992 losvedir https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36520992 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36520992 I don&#39;t buy this.

And advertisement is the rich asking for more money. A man would be annoyed if he found himself in a mob of millionaires, all holding out their silk hats for a penny; or all shouting with one voice, “Give me money.” Yet advertisement does really assault the eye very much as such a shout would assault the ear. “Budge&#39;s Boots are the Best” simply means “Give me money”; “Use Seraphic Soap” simply means “Give me money.” It is a complete mistake to suppose that common people make our towns commonplace, with unsightly things like advertisements. Most of those whose wares are thus placarded everywhere are very wealthy gentlemen with coronets and country seats, men who are probably very particular about the artistic adornment of their own homes. They disfigure their towns in order to decorate their houses. — GK Chesterton, <i>The New Jersusalem</i> <a href="http://www.gkc.org.uk/gkc/books/GKC_New_Jerusalem.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.gkc.org.uk/gkc/books/GKC_New_Jerusalem.html</a> ]]>; Fri, 30 Jun 2023 16:11:03 +0000</span> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 lolinder https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 I block ads because they&#39;re psychological warfare that corporations wage against me. I don&#39;t care how unobtrusive the ads are. I don&#39;t care if the ads don&#39;t track me. I grew up changing the channel on TV when ads came on, and ripping adverts out of magazines before sitting down to read them. I vote for billboard bans whenever I can. I have zero tolerance for ads of any sort. Advertisers have no morals, they&#39;re completely depraved. They&#39;ll eagerly exploit a teenager&#39;s self-conscious body issues to sell useless beauty products.

It&#39;s because they&#39;ve become increasingly obnoxious. Nobody blocked ads when they were a simple column of links in the gutter or maybe an animated GIF banner with 3 frames. No, adblockers became popular because ads kept getting more loud (both visually and audibly), in your face, and resource hungry (remember those flash ads that&#39;d keep your CPU pegged?).

Some of those descendants are very successful now and some descendants of slave owners are probably very poor now. And some people are descendants of both. And then I learn about the Jim Crow period, and then you hear that even the GI bill explicitly excluded black people, and lynchings into the 1950s, and the extremely hard fight the civil rights movement had, and even legal discrimination up to 1971, not to mention tons of possibly illegal but still very real discrimination after that. And then I think: you can&#39;t just stop doing a bad thing and pretend it didn&#39;t happen. You&#39;ve got to try to make things right. Have things been made right by now? I have no idea. I do know plenty of black people still live in fear of the police, and that when black people call the police, there&#39;s the non-zero chance that they&#39;re the ones who end up getting shot. Not to mention that many universities also have affirmative action for children of alumni, who are still predominantly white and rich, partially because of the legal discrimination uo to 1971, and partially because universities are ridiculously expensive. Has that affirmative action also been struck down? >; America is not in the least social-democratic, It used to be, though.

Right? I mean, I can get behind that. But then why the entire detour with race? Up until about 1971 (possibly later, but that&#39;s the date of <i>Loving vs Virginia</i> ), the US had formal, legal discrimination against black people. On finally removing that, there was at various times discussion of whether people who had been legally discriminated against all their lives should be compensated, as if they had been wronged in a tort sense. This would obviously be extremely expensive, and anyway impossible to quantify, so it never happened. Harvard, and many other colleges, has a big base of &quot;legacy&quot; admissions, as well as a certain amount of generational knowledge and connections - you&#39;re more likely to get into Harvard if your parents went to Harvard, over and above mere class status. Since black people were under-represented in this category, people came up with the idea of putting a thumb on the other side of the scale and artificially increasing their rate of admission. Can it balance exactly against the disadvantages of discrimination? No. >; I genuinely don&#39;t get why the race thing is part of the equation. Shouldn&#39;t this just be run-of-the-mill social democratic &quot;lets hand out some extra opportunities/benefits to the poor&quot; program?

Affirmative Action probably helped my father, whose father was a construction worker and mother a homemaker both of whom dropped out of high school, get into college and ultimately become a doctor. But because my father was a doctor, I had a fairly privileged upbringing. I&#39;m a generation removed, but growing up in California always had to indicate my background on standardized tests and always checked &quot;White&quot; for race and then &quot;Hispanic&quot; for ethnicity (which is how all the tests asked it in those days, not sure if it&#39;s still the case), without thinking much about it.

But it also feels totally irrelevant to me, personally, because of my upper class upbringing and elite education, and I feel like I&#39;ve never really been discriminated against. Though I possibly have been discriminated &quot;for&quot;, and benefited tremendously from it. So I don&#39;t know how I feel about this change. It&#39;s certainly a big one, but in the long run, maybe it&#39;s good?

And advertisement is the rich asking for more money. A man would be annoyed if he found himself in a mob of millionaires, all holding out their silk hats for a penny; or all shouting with one voice, “Give me money.” Yet advertisement does really assault the eye very much as such a shout would assault the ear. “Budge&#39;s Boots are the Best” simply means “Give me money”; “Use Seraphic Soap” simply means “Give me money.” It is a complete mistake to suppose that common people make our towns commonplace, with unsightly things like advertisements. Most of those whose wares are thus placarded everywhere are very wealthy gentlemen with coronets and country seats, men who are probably very particular about the artistic adornment of their own homes. They disfigure their towns in order to decorate their houses. — GK Chesterton, <i>The New Jersusalem</i> <a href="http://www.gkc.org.uk/gkc/books/GKC_New_Jerusalem.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.gkc.org.uk/gkc/books/GKC_New_Jerusalem.html</a> ]]>; Fri, 30 Jun 2023 16:11:03 +0000</span> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 lolinder https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 I block ads because they&#39;re psychological warfare that corporations wage against me.

I have zero tolerance for ads of any sort. Advertisers have no morals, they&#39;re completely depraved. They&#39;ll eagerly exploit a teenager&#39;s self-conscious body issues to sell useless beauty products.

It&#39;s because they&#39;ve become increasingly obnoxious. Nobody blocked ads when they were a simple column of links in the gutter or maybe an animated GIF banner with 3 frames. No, adblockers became popular because ads kept getting more loud (both visually and audibly), in your face, and resource hungry (remember those flash ads that&#39;d keep your CPU pegged?).

Some of those descendants are very successful now and some descendants of slave owners are probably very poor now. And some people are descendants of both. And then I learn about the Jim Crow period, and then you hear that even the GI bill explicitly excluded black people, and lynchings into the 1950s, and the extremely hard fight the civil rights movement had, and even legal discrimination up to 1971, not to mention tons of possibly illegal but still very real discrimination after that. And then I think: you can&#39;t just stop doing a bad thing and pretend it didn&#39;t happen. You&#39;ve got to try to make things right. Have things been made right by now? I have no idea. I do know plenty of black people still live in fear of the police, and that when black people call the police, there&#39;s the non-zero chance that they&#39;re the ones who end up getting shot. Not to mention that many universities also have affirmative action for children of alumni, who are still predominantly white and rich, partially because of the legal discrimination uo to 1971, and partially because universities are ridiculously expensive. Has that affirmative action also been struck down? >; America is not in the least social-democratic, It used to be, though.

Right? I mean, I can get behind that. But then why the entire detour with race? Up until about 1971 (possibly later, but that&#39;s the date of <i>Loving vs Virginia</i> ), the US had formal, legal discrimination against black people. On finally removing that, there was at various times discussion of whether people who had been legally discriminated against all their lives should be compensated, as if they had been wronged in a tort sense. This would obviously be extremely expensive, and anyway impossible to quantify, so it never happened. Harvard, and many other colleges, has a big base of &quot;legacy&quot; admissions, as well as a certain amount of generational knowledge and connections - you&#39;re more likely to get into Harvard if your parents went to Harvard, over and above mere class status. Since black people were under-represented in this category, people came up with the idea of putting a thumb on the other side of the scale and artificially increasing their rate of admission. Can it balance exactly against the disadvantages of discrimination? No. >; I genuinely don&#39;t get why the race thing is part of the equation. Shouldn&#39;t this just be run-of-the-mill social democratic &quot;lets hand out some extra opportunities/benefits to the poor&quot; program? America is not in the least social-democratic, but racism and anti-racism have been there since the beginning and will probably dominate US politics until the last person who remembers the KKK is dead.

Affirmative Action probably helped my father, whose father was a construction worker and mother a homemaker both of whom dropped out of high school, get into college and ultimately become a doctor. But because my father was a doctor, I had a fairly privileged upbringing. I&#39;m a generation removed, but growing up in California always had to indicate my background on standardized tests and always checked &quot;White&quot; for race and then &quot;Hispanic&quot; for ethnicity (which is how all the tests asked it in those days, not sure if it&#39;s still the case), without thinking much about it.

But it also feels totally irrelevant to me, personally, because of my upper class upbringing and elite education, and I feel like I&#39;ve never really been discriminated against. Though I possibly have been discriminated &quot;for&quot;, and benefited tremendously from it. So I don&#39;t know how I feel about this change. It&#39;s certainly a big one, but in the long run, maybe it&#39;s good?

And advertisement is the rich asking for more money. A man would be annoyed if he found himself in a mob of millionaires, all holding out their silk hats for a penny; or all shouting with one voice, “Give me money.” Yet advertisement does really assault the eye very much as such a shout would assault the ear. “Budge&#39;s Boots are the Best” simply means “Give me money”; “Use Seraphic Soap” simply means “Give me money.” It is a complete mistake to suppose that common people make our towns commonplace, with unsightly things like advertisements. Most of those whose wares are thus placarded everywhere are very wealthy gentlemen with coronets and country seats, men who are probably very particular about the artistic adornment of their own homes. They disfigure their towns in order to decorate their houses. — GK Chesterton, <i>The New Jersusalem</i> <a href="http://www.gkc.org.uk/gkc/books/GKC_New_Jerusalem.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.gkc.org.uk/gkc/books/GKC_New_Jerusalem.html</a> ]]>; Fri, 30 Jun 2023 16:11:03 +0000</span> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 lolinder https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 I block ads because they&#39;re psychological warfare that corporations wage against me. I don&#39;t care how unobtrusive the ads are. I don&#39;t care if the ads don&#39;t track me.

I have zero tolerance for ads of any sort. Advertisers have no morals, they&#39;re completely depraved. They&#39;ll eagerly exploit a teenager&#39;s self-conscious body issues to sell useless beauty products.

It&#39;s because they&#39;ve become increasingly obnoxious. Nobody blocked ads when they were a simple column of links in the gutter or maybe an animated GIF banner with 3 frames. No, adblockers became popular because ads kept getting more loud (both visually and audibly), in your face, and resource hungry (remember those flash ads that&#39;d keep your CPU pegged?).

Some of those descendants are very successful now and some descendants of slave owners are probably very poor now. And some people are descendants of both. And then I learn about the Jim Crow period, and then you hear that even the GI bill explicitly excluded black people, and lynchings into the 1950s, and the extremely hard fight the civil rights movement had, and even legal discrimination up to 1971, not to mention tons of possibly illegal but still very real discrimination after that. And then I think: you can&#39;t just stop doing a bad thing and pretend it didn&#39;t happen. You&#39;ve got to try to make things right. Have things been made right by now? I have no idea. I do know plenty of black people still live in fear of the police, and that when black people call the police, there&#39;s the non-zero chance that they&#39;re the ones who end up getting shot. Not to mention that many universities also have affirmative action for children of alumni, who are still predominantly white and rich, partially because of the legal discrimination uo to 1971, and partially because universities are ridiculously expensive. Has that affirmative action also been struck down? >; America is not in the least social-democratic, It used to be, though. The New Deal and many of the social policies of the 1940s and 1950s were very social democratic.

Right? I mean, I can get behind that. But then why the entire detour with race? Up until about 1971 (possibly later, but that&#39;s the date of <i>Loving vs Virginia</i> ), the US had formal, legal discrimination against black people. On finally removing that, there was at various times discussion of whether people who had been legally discriminated against all their lives should be compensated, as if they had been wronged in a tort sense. This would obviously be extremely expensive, and anyway impossible to quantify, so it never happened. Harvard, and many other colleges, has a big base of &quot;legacy&quot; admissions, as well as a certain amount of generational knowledge and connections - you&#39;re more likely to get into Harvard if your parents went to Harvard, over and above mere class status. Since black people were under-represented in this category, people came up with the idea of putting a thumb on the other side of the scale and artificially increasing their rate of admission. Can it balance exactly against the disadvantages of discrimination? No. >; I genuinely don&#39;t get why the race thing is part of the equation. Shouldn&#39;t this just be run-of-the-mill social democratic &quot;lets hand out some extra opportunities/benefits to the poor&quot; program? America is not in the least social-democratic, but racism and anti-racism have been there since the beginning and will probably dominate US politics until the last person who remembers the KKK is dead.

Affirmative Action probably helped my father, whose father was a construction worker and mother a homemaker both of whom dropped out of high school, get into college and ultimately become a doctor.

But it also feels totally irrelevant to me, personally, because of my upper class upbringing and elite education, and I feel like I&#39;ve never really been discriminated against. Though I possibly have been discriminated &quot;for&quot;, and benefited tremendously from it. So I don&#39;t know how I feel about this change. It&#39;s certainly a big one, but in the long run, maybe it&#39;s good?

And advertisement is the rich asking for more money. A man would be annoyed if he found himself in a mob of millionaires, all holding out their silk hats for a penny; or all shouting with one voice, “Give me money.” Yet advertisement does really assault the eye very much as such a shout would assault the ear. “Budge&#39;s Boots are the Best” simply means “Give me money”; “Use Seraphic Soap” simply means “Give me money.” It is a complete mistake to suppose that common people make our towns commonplace, with unsightly things like advertisements. Most of those whose wares are thus placarded everywhere are very wealthy gentlemen with coronets and country seats, men who are probably very particular about the artistic adornment of their own homes.

It&#39;s because they&#39;ve become increasingly obnoxious. Nobody blocked ads when they were a simple column of links in the gutter or maybe an animated GIF banner with 3 frames. No, adblockers became popular because ads kept getting more loud (both visually and audibly), in your face, and resource hungry (remember those flash ads that&#39;d keep your CPU pegged?).

Some of those descendants are very successful now and some descendants of slave owners are probably very poor now. And some people are descendants of both. And then I learn about the Jim Crow period, and then you hear that even the GI bill explicitly excluded black people, and lynchings into the 1950s, and the extremely hard fight the civil rights movement had, and even legal discrimination up to 1971, not to mention tons of possibly illegal but still very real discrimination after that. And then I think: you can&#39;t just stop doing a bad thing and pretend it didn&#39;t happen. You&#39;ve got to try to make things right. Have things been made right by now? I have no idea. I do know plenty of black people still live in fear of the police, and that when black people call the police, there&#39;s the non-zero chance that they&#39;re the ones who end up getting shot. Not to mention that many universities also have affirmative action for children of alumni, who are still predominantly white and rich, partially because of the legal discrimination uo to 1971, and partially because universities are ridiculously expensive. Has that affirmative action also been struck down? >; America is not in the least social-democratic, It used to be, though.

Right? I mean, I can get behind that. But then why the entire detour with race? Up until about 1971 (possibly later, but that&#39;s the date of <i>Loving vs Virginia</i> ), the US had formal, legal discrimination against black people. On finally removing that, there was at various times discussion of whether people who had been legally discriminated against all their lives should be compensated, as if they had been wronged in a tort sense. This would obviously be extremely expensive, and anyway impossible to quantify, so it never happened. Harvard, and many other colleges, has a big base of &quot;legacy&quot; admissions, as well as a certain amount of generational knowledge and connections - you&#39;re more likely to get into Harvard if your parents went to Harvard, over and above mere class status. Since black people were under-represented in this category, people came up with the idea of putting a thumb on the other side of the scale and artificially increasing their rate of admission. Can it balance exactly against the disadvantages of discrimination? No. >; I genuinely don&#39;t get why the race thing is part of the equation. Shouldn&#39;t this just be run-of-the-mill social democratic &quot;lets hand out some extra opportunities/benefits to the poor&quot; program? America is not in the least social-democratic, but racism and anti-racism have been there since the beginning and will probably dominate US politics until the last person who remembers the KKK is dead.

But it also feels totally irrelevant to me, personally, because of my upper class upbringing and elite education, and I feel like I&#39;ve never really been discriminated against. Though I possibly have been discriminated &quot;for&quot;, and benefited tremendously from it. So I don&#39;t know how I feel about this change. It&#39;s certainly a big one, but in the long run, maybe it&#39;s good?

And advertisement is the rich asking for more money. A man would be annoyed if he found himself in a mob of millionaires, all holding out their silk hats for a penny; or all shouting with one voice, “Give me money.” Yet advertisement does really assault the eye very much as such a shout would assault the ear. “Budge&#39;s Boots are the Best” simply means “Give me money”; “Use Seraphic Soap” simply means “Give me money.” It is a complete mistake to suppose that common people make our towns commonplace, with unsightly things like advertisements. Most of those whose wares are thus placarded everywhere are very wealthy gentlemen with coronets and country seats, men who are probably very particular about the artistic adornment of their own homes.

It&#39;s because they&#39;ve become increasingly obnoxious. Nobody blocked ads when they were a simple column of links in the gutter or maybe an animated GIF banner with 3 frames. No, adblockers became popular because ads kept getting more loud (both visually and audibly), in your face, and resource hungry (remember those flash ads that&#39;d keep your CPU pegged?).

Some of those descendants are very successful now and some descendants of slave owners are probably very poor now. And some people are descendants of both. And then I learn about the Jim Crow period, and then you hear that even the GI bill explicitly excluded black people, and lynchings into the 1950s, and the extremely hard fight the civil rights movement had, and even legal discrimination up to 1971, not to mention tons of possibly illegal but still very real discrimination after that. And then I think: you can&#39;t just stop doing a bad thing and pretend it didn&#39;t happen. You&#39;ve got to try to make things right. Have things been made right by now? I have no idea. I do know plenty of black people still live in fear of the police, and that when black people call the police, there&#39;s the non-zero chance that they&#39;re the ones who end up getting shot. Not to mention that many universities also have affirmative action for children of alumni, who are still predominantly white and rich, partially because of the legal discrimination uo to 1971, and partially because universities are ridiculously expensive. Has that affirmative action also been struck down? >; America is not in the least social-democratic, It used to be, though.

Right? I mean, I can get behind that. But then why the entire detour with race? Up until about 1971 (possibly later, but that&#39;s the date of <i>Loving vs Virginia</i> ), the US had formal, legal discrimination against black people. On finally removing that, there was at various times discussion of whether people who had been legally discriminated against all their lives should be compensated, as if they had been wronged in a tort sense. This would obviously be extremely expensive, and anyway impossible to quantify, so it never happened. Harvard, and many other colleges, has a big base of &quot;legacy&quot; admissions, as well as a certain amount of generational knowledge and connections - you&#39;re more likely to get into Harvard if your parents went to Harvard, over and above mere class status. Since black people were under-represented in this category, people came up with the idea of putting a thumb on the other side of the scale and artificially increasing their rate of admission. Can it balance exactly against the disadvantages of discrimination? No. >; I genuinely don&#39;t get why the race thing is part of the equation. Shouldn&#39;t this just be run-of-the-mill social democratic &quot;lets hand out some extra opportunities/benefits to the poor&quot; program? America is not in the least social-democratic, but racism and anti-racism have been there since the beginning and will probably dominate US politics until the last person who remembers the KKK is dead.

Affirmative Action probably helped my father, whose father was a construction worker and mother a homemaker both of whom dropped out of high school, get into college and ultimately become a doctor. But because my father was a doctor, I had a fairly privileged upbringing. I&#39;m a generation removed, but growing up in California always had to indicate my background on standardized tests and always checked &quot;White&quot; for race and then &quot;Hispanic&quot; for ethnicity (which is how all the tests asked it in those days, not sure if it&#39;s still the case), without thinking much about it. I went to MIT, and to this day I wonder how much checking &quot;Hispanic&quot; helped me there and if I &quot;deserved&quot; to go. I was valedictorian and had a perfect score on the SATs and I feel like I was a strong candidate, but then everyone who gets into MIT is strong. And since I did successfully graduate then I guess it was fine that I was accepted, but I was constantly blown away and overwhelmed by the accomplishments of my peers there, and always wondered a bit if I belonged. I&#39;ve always had an identity crisis about what I am. I know in the current zeitgeist there&#39;s a big push for racial justice, of which being Hispanic and &quot;brown&quot; is a part. But it also feels totally irrelevant to me, personally, because of my upper class upbringing and elite education, and I feel like I&#39;ve never really been discriminated against. Though I possibly have been discriminated &quot;for&quot;, and benefited tremendously from it. So I don&#39;t know how I feel about this change. It&#39;s certainly a big one, but in the long run, maybe it&#39;s good? I know I&#39;ve always wondered if being Hispanic helped me get into college or into jobs, but the flip side is that other people must wonder the same... ]]>; Thu, 29 Jun 2023 14:40:31 +0000</span> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36520992 losvedir https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36520992 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36520992 I don&#39;t buy this.

Twitter takes 6 seconds to load the homepage and display the single tweet which fits on it.<code> preview images take a little longer to load</code> Preview images of what?

And advertisement is the rich asking for more money. A man would be annoyed if he found himself in a mob of millionaires, all holding out their silk hats for a penny; or all shouting with one voice, “Give me money.” Yet advertisement does really assault the eye very much as such a shout would assault the ear. “Budge&#39;s Boots are the Best” simply means “Give me money”; “Use Seraphic Soap” simply means “Give me money.” It is a complete mistake to suppose that common people make our towns commonplace, with unsightly things like advertisements. Most of those whose wares are thus placarded everywhere are very wealthy gentlemen with coronets and country seats, men who are probably very particular about the artistic adornment of their own homes. They disfigure their towns in order to decorate their houses. — GK Chesterton, <i>The New Jersusalem</i> <a href="http://www.gkc.org.uk/gkc/books/GKC_New_Jerusalem.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.gkc.org.uk/gkc/books/GKC_New_Jerusalem.html</a> ]]>; Fri, 30 Jun 2023 16:11:03 +0000</span> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 lolinder https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 I block ads because they&#39;re psychological warfare that corporations wage against me. I don&#39;t care how unobtrusive the ads are. I don&#39;t care if the ads don&#39;t track me. I grew up changing the channel on TV when ads came on, and ripping adverts out of magazines before sitting down to read them. I vote for billboard bans whenever I can. I have zero tolerance for ads of any sort. Advertisers have no morals, they&#39;re completely depraved. They&#39;ll eagerly exploit a teenager&#39;s self-conscious body issues to sell useless beauty products. They sell sugar water to fat people and at every turn promote the rampant consumerist culture that is destroying our planet.

It&#39;s because they&#39;ve become increasingly obnoxious. Nobody blocked ads when they were a simple column of links in the gutter or maybe an animated GIF banner with 3 frames. No, adblockers became popular because ads kept getting more loud (both visually and audibly), in your face, and resource hungry (remember those flash ads that&#39;d keep your CPU pegged?).

Some of those descendants are very successful now and some descendants of slave owners are probably very poor now. And some people are descendants of both. And then I learn about the Jim Crow period, and then you hear that even the GI bill explicitly excluded black people, and lynchings into the 1950s, and the extremely hard fight the civil rights movement had, and even legal discrimination up to 1971, not to mention tons of possibly illegal but still very real discrimination after that. And then I think: you can&#39;t just stop doing a bad thing and pretend it didn&#39;t happen. You&#39;ve got to try to make things right. Have things been made right by now? I have no idea. I do know plenty of black people still live in fear of the police, and that when black people call the police, there&#39;s the non-zero chance that they&#39;re the ones who end up getting shot. Not to mention that many universities also have affirmative action for children of alumni, who are still predominantly white and rich, partially because of the legal discrimination uo to 1971, and partially because universities are ridiculously expensive. Has that affirmative action also been struck down? >; America is not in the least social-democratic, It used to be, though.

Right? I mean, I can get behind that. But then why the entire detour with race? Up until about 1971 (possibly later, but that&#39;s the date of <i>Loving vs Virginia</i> ), the US had formal, legal discrimination against black people. On finally removing that, there was at various times discussion of whether people who had been legally discriminated against all their lives should be compensated, as if they had been wronged in a tort sense. This would obviously be extremely expensive, and anyway impossible to quantify, so it never happened. Harvard, and many other colleges, has a big base of &quot;legacy&quot; admissions, as well as a certain amount of generational knowledge and connections - you&#39;re more likely to get into Harvard if your parents went to Harvard, over and above mere class status. Since black people were under-represented in this category, people came up with the idea of putting a thumb on the other side of the scale and artificially increasing their rate of admission. Can it balance exactly against the disadvantages of discrimination? No. >; I genuinely don&#39;t get why the race thing is part of the equation. Shouldn&#39;t this just be run-of-the-mill social democratic &quot;lets hand out some extra opportunities/benefits to the poor&quot; program?

Affirmative Action probably helped my father, whose father was a construction worker and mother a homemaker both of whom dropped out of high school, get into college and ultimately become a doctor.

But it also feels totally irrelevant to me, personally, because of my upper class upbringing and elite education, and I feel like I&#39;ve never really been discriminated against. Though I possibly have been discriminated &quot;for&quot;, and benefited tremendously from it. So I don&#39;t know how I feel about this change. It&#39;s certainly a big one, but in the long run, maybe it&#39;s good?

And advertisement is the rich asking for more money. A man would be annoyed if he found himself in a mob of millionaires, all holding out their silk hats for a penny; or all shouting with one voice, “Give me money.” Yet advertisement does really assault the eye very much as such a shout would assault the ear. “Budge&#39;s Boots are the Best” simply means “Give me money”; “Use Seraphic Soap” simply means “Give me money.” It is a complete mistake to suppose that common people make our towns commonplace, with unsightly things like advertisements. Most of those whose wares are thus placarded everywhere are very wealthy gentlemen with coronets and country seats, men who are probably very particular about the artistic adornment of their own homes.

It&#39;s because they&#39;ve become increasingly obnoxious. Nobody blocked ads when they were a simple column of links in the gutter or maybe an animated GIF banner with 3 frames. No, adblockers became popular because ads kept getting more loud (both visually and audibly), in your face, and resource hungry (remember those flash ads that&#39;d keep your CPU pegged?).

Some of those descendants are very successful now and some descendants of slave owners are probably very poor now. And some people are descendants of both. And then I learn about the Jim Crow period, and then you hear that even the GI bill explicitly excluded black people, and lynchings into the 1950s, and the extremely hard fight the civil rights movement had, and even legal discrimination up to 1971, not to mention tons of possibly illegal but still very real discrimination after that. And then I think: you can&#39;t just stop doing a bad thing and pretend it didn&#39;t happen. You&#39;ve got to try to make things right. Have things been made right by now? I have no idea. I do know plenty of black people still live in fear of the police, and that when black people call the police, there&#39;s the non-zero chance that they&#39;re the ones who end up getting shot. Not to mention that many universities also have affirmative action for children of alumni, who are still predominantly white and rich, partially because of the legal discrimination uo to 1971, and partially because universities are ridiculously expensive. Has that affirmative action also been struck down? >; America is not in the least social-democratic, It used to be, though.

Right? I mean, I can get behind that. But then why the entire detour with race? Up until about 1971 (possibly later, but that&#39;s the date of <i>Loving vs Virginia</i> ), the US had formal, legal discrimination against black people. On finally removing that, there was at various times discussion of whether people who had been legally discriminated against all their lives should be compensated, as if they had been wronged in a tort sense. This would obviously be extremely expensive, and anyway impossible to quantify, so it never happened. Harvard, and many other colleges, has a big base of &quot;legacy&quot; admissions, as well as a certain amount of generational knowledge and connections - you&#39;re more likely to get into Harvard if your parents went to Harvard, over and above mere class status. Since black people were under-represented in this category, people came up with the idea of putting a thumb on the other side of the scale and artificially increasing their rate of admission. Can it balance exactly against the disadvantages of discrimination? No. >; I genuinely don&#39;t get why the race thing is part of the equation. Shouldn&#39;t this just be run-of-the-mill social democratic &quot;lets hand out some extra opportunities/benefits to the poor&quot; program?

Affirmative Action probably helped my father, whose father was a construction worker and mother a homemaker both of whom dropped out of high school, get into college and ultimately become a doctor.

But it also feels totally irrelevant to me, personally, because of my upper class upbringing and elite education, and I feel like I&#39;ve never really been discriminated against. Though I possibly have been discriminated &quot;for&quot;, and benefited tremendously from it. So I don&#39;t know how I feel about this change. It&#39;s certainly a big one, but in the long run, maybe it&#39;s good?

And advertisement is the rich asking for more money. A man would be annoyed if he found himself in a mob of millionaires, all holding out their silk hats for a penny; or all shouting with one voice, “Give me money.” Yet advertisement does really assault the eye very much as such a shout would assault the ear. “Budge&#39;s Boots are the Best” simply means “Give me money”; “Use Seraphic Soap” simply means “Give me money.” It is a complete mistake to suppose that common people make our towns commonplace, with unsightly things like advertisements. Most of those whose wares are thus placarded everywhere are very wealthy gentlemen with coronets and country seats, men who are probably very particular about the artistic adornment of their own homes.

It&#39;s because they&#39;ve become increasingly obnoxious. Nobody blocked ads when they were a simple column of links in the gutter or maybe an animated GIF banner with 3 frames. No, adblockers became popular because ads kept getting more loud (both visually and audibly), in your face, and resource hungry (remember those flash ads that&#39;d keep your CPU pegged?).

Some of those descendants are very successful now and some descendants of slave owners are probably very poor now. And some people are descendants of both. And then I learn about the Jim Crow period, and then you hear that even the GI bill explicitly excluded black people, and lynchings into the 1950s, and the extremely hard fight the civil rights movement had, and even legal discrimination up to 1971, not to mention tons of possibly illegal but still very real discrimination after that. And then I think: you can&#39;t just stop doing a bad thing and pretend it didn&#39;t happen. You&#39;ve got to try to make things right. Have things been made right by now? I have no idea. I do know plenty of black people still live in fear of the police, and that when black people call the police, there&#39;s the non-zero chance that they&#39;re the ones who end up getting shot. Not to mention that many universities also have affirmative action for children of alumni, who are still predominantly white and rich, partially because of the legal discrimination uo to 1971, and partially because universities are ridiculously expensive. Has that affirmative action also been struck down? >; America is not in the least social-democratic, It used to be, though.

Right? I mean, I can get behind that. But then why the entire detour with race? Up until about 1971 (possibly later, but that&#39;s the date of <i>Loving vs Virginia</i> ), the US had formal, legal discrimination against black people. On finally removing that, there was at various times discussion of whether people who had been legally discriminated against all their lives should be compensated, as if they had been wronged in a tort sense. This would obviously be extremely expensive, and anyway impossible to quantify, so it never happened. Harvard, and many other colleges, has a big base of &quot;legacy&quot; admissions, as well as a certain amount of generational knowledge and connections - you&#39;re more likely to get into Harvard if your parents went to Harvard, over and above mere class status. Since black people were under-represented in this category, people came up with the idea of putting a thumb on the other side of the scale and artificially increasing their rate of admission. Can it balance exactly against the disadvantages of discrimination? No. >; I genuinely don&#39;t get why the race thing is part of the equation. Shouldn&#39;t this just be run-of-the-mill social democratic &quot;lets hand out some extra opportunities/benefits to the poor&quot; program? America is not in the least social-democratic, but racism and anti-racism have been there since the beginning and will probably dominate US politics until the last person who remembers the KKK is dead.

But it also feels totally irrelevant to me, personally, because of my upper class upbringing and elite education, and I feel like I&#39;ve never really been discriminated against. Though I possibly have been discriminated &quot;for&quot;, and benefited tremendously from it. So I don&#39;t know how I feel about this change. It&#39;s certainly a big one, but in the long run, maybe it&#39;s good?

And advertisement is the rich asking for more money. A man would be annoyed if he found himself in a mob of millionaires, all holding out their silk hats for a penny; or all shouting with one voice, “Give me money.” Yet advertisement does really assault the eye very much as such a shout would assault the ear. “Budge&#39;s Boots are the Best” simply means “Give me money”; “Use Seraphic Soap” simply means “Give me money.” It is a complete mistake to suppose that common people make our towns commonplace, with unsightly things like advertisements. Most of those whose wares are thus placarded everywhere are very wealthy gentlemen with coronets and country seats, men who are probably very particular about the artistic adornment of their own homes.

It&#39;s because they&#39;ve become increasingly obnoxious. Nobody blocked ads when they were a simple column of links in the gutter or maybe an animated GIF banner with 3 frames. No, adblockers became popular because ads kept getting more loud (both visually and audibly), in your face, and resource hungry (remember those flash ads that&#39;d keep your CPU pegged?).

Some of those descendants are very successful now and some descendants of slave owners are probably very poor now. And some people are descendants of both. And then I learn about the Jim Crow period, and then you hear that even the GI bill explicitly excluded black people, and lynchings into the 1950s, and the extremely hard fight the civil rights movement had, and even legal discrimination up to 1971, not to mention tons of possibly illegal but still very real discrimination after that. And then I think: you can&#39;t just stop doing a bad thing and pretend it didn&#39;t happen. You&#39;ve got to try to make things right. Have things been made right by now? I have no idea. I do know plenty of black people still live in fear of the police, and that when black people call the police, there&#39;s the non-zero chance that they&#39;re the ones who end up getting shot. Not to mention that many universities also have affirmative action for children of alumni, who are still predominantly white and rich, partially because of the legal discrimination uo to 1971, and partially because universities are ridiculously expensive. Has that affirmative action also been struck down? >; America is not in the least social-democratic, It used to be, though.

Right? I mean, I can get behind that. But then why the entire detour with race? Up until about 1971 (possibly later, but that&#39;s the date of <i>Loving vs Virginia</i> ), the US had formal, legal discrimination against black people. On finally removing that, there was at various times discussion of whether people who had been legally discriminated against all their lives should be compensated, as if they had been wronged in a tort sense. This would obviously be extremely expensive, and anyway impossible to quantify, so it never happened. Harvard, and many other colleges, has a big base of &quot;legacy&quot; admissions, as well as a certain amount of generational knowledge and connections - you&#39;re more likely to get into Harvard if your parents went to Harvard, over and above mere class status. Since black people were under-represented in this category, people came up with the idea of putting a thumb on the other side of the scale and artificially increasing their rate of admission. Can it balance exactly against the disadvantages of discrimination? No. >; I genuinely don&#39;t get why the race thing is part of the equation. Shouldn&#39;t this just be run-of-the-mill social democratic &quot;lets hand out some extra opportunities/benefits to the poor&quot; program? America is not in the least social-democratic, but racism and anti-racism have been there since the beginning and will probably dominate US politics until the last person who remembers the KKK is dead.

Affirmative Action probably helped my father, whose father was a construction worker and mother a homemaker both of whom dropped out of high school, get into college and ultimately become a doctor. But because my father was a doctor, I had a fairly privileged upbringing. I&#39;m a generation removed, but growing up in California always had to indicate my background on standardized tests and always checked &quot;White&quot; for race and then &quot;Hispanic&quot; for ethnicity (which is how all the tests asked it in those days, not sure if it&#39;s still the case), without thinking much about it. I went to MIT, and to this day I wonder how much checking &quot;Hispanic&quot; helped me there and if I &quot;deserved&quot; to go. I was valedictorian and had a perfect score on the SATs and I feel like I was a strong candidate, but then everyone who gets into MIT is strong. And since I did successfully graduate then I guess it was fine that I was accepted, but I was constantly blown away and overwhelmed by the accomplishments of my peers there, and always wondered a bit if I belonged. I&#39;ve always had an identity crisis about what I am. I know in the current zeitgeist there&#39;s a big push for racial justice, of which being Hispanic and &quot;brown&quot; is a part. But it also feels totally irrelevant to me, personally, because of my upper class upbringing and elite education, and I feel like I&#39;ve never really been discriminated against. Though I possibly have been discriminated &quot;for&quot;, and benefited tremendously from it. So I don&#39;t know how I feel about this change. It&#39;s certainly a big one, but in the long run, maybe it&#39;s good? I know I&#39;ve always wondered if being Hispanic helped me get into college or into jobs, but the flip side is that other people must wonder the same... ]]>; Thu, 29 Jun 2023 14:40:31 +0000</span> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36520992 losvedir https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36520992 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36520992 I don&#39;t buy this.

Twitter takes 6 seconds to load the homepage and display the single tweet which fits on it.<code> preview images take a little longer to load</code> Preview images of what?

And advertisement is the rich asking for more money. A man would be annoyed if he found himself in a mob of millionaires, all holding out their silk hats for a penny; or all shouting with one voice, “Give me money.” Yet advertisement does really assault the eye very much as such a shout would assault the ear. “Budge&#39;s Boots are the Best” simply means “Give me money”; “Use Seraphic Soap” simply means “Give me money.” It is a complete mistake to suppose that common people make our towns commonplace, with unsightly things like advertisements. Most of those whose wares are thus placarded everywhere are very wealthy gentlemen with coronets and country seats, men who are probably very particular about the artistic adornment of their own homes. They disfigure their towns in order to decorate their houses. — GK Chesterton, <i>The New Jersusalem</i> <a href="http://www.gkc.org.uk/gkc/books/GKC_New_Jerusalem.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.gkc.org.uk/gkc/books/GKC_New_Jerusalem.html</a> ]]>; Fri, 30 Jun 2023 16:11:03 +0000</span> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 lolinder https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 I block ads because they&#39;re psychological warfare that corporations wage against me. I don&#39;t care how unobtrusive the ads are. I don&#39;t care if the ads don&#39;t track me. I grew up changing the channel on TV when ads came on, and ripping adverts out of magazines before sitting down to read them. I vote for billboard bans whenever I can. I have zero tolerance for ads of any sort. Advertisers have no morals, they&#39;re completely depraved. They&#39;ll eagerly exploit a teenager&#39;s self-conscious body issues to sell useless beauty products. They sell sugar water to fat people and at every turn promote the rampant consumerist culture that is destroying our planet.

It&#39;s because they&#39;ve become increasingly obnoxious. Nobody blocked ads when they were a simple column of links in the gutter or maybe an animated GIF banner with 3 frames. No, adblockers became popular because ads kept getting more loud (both visually and audibly), in your face, and resource hungry (remember those flash ads that&#39;d keep your CPU pegged?).

Some of those descendants are very successful now and some descendants of slave owners are probably very poor now. And some people are descendants of both. And then I learn about the Jim Crow period, and then you hear that even the GI bill explicitly excluded black people, and lynchings into the 1950s, and the extremely hard fight the civil rights movement had, and even legal discrimination up to 1971, not to mention tons of possibly illegal but still very real discrimination after that. And then I think: you can&#39;t just stop doing a bad thing and pretend it didn&#39;t happen. You&#39;ve got to try to make things right. Have things been made right by now? I have no idea. I do know plenty of black people still live in fear of the police, and that when black people call the police, there&#39;s the non-zero chance that they&#39;re the ones who end up getting shot. Not to mention that many universities also have affirmative action for children of alumni, who are still predominantly white and rich, partially because of the legal discrimination uo to 1971, and partially because universities are ridiculously expensive. Has that affirmative action also been struck down? >; America is not in the least social-democratic, It used to be, though.

Right? I mean, I can get behind that. But then why the entire detour with race? Up until about 1971 (possibly later, but that&#39;s the date of <i>Loving vs Virginia</i> ), the US had formal, legal discrimination against black people. On finally removing that, there was at various times discussion of whether people who had been legally discriminated against all their lives should be compensated, as if they had been wronged in a tort sense. This would obviously be extremely expensive, and anyway impossible to quantify, so it never happened. Harvard, and many other colleges, has a big base of &quot;legacy&quot; admissions, as well as a certain amount of generational knowledge and connections - you&#39;re more likely to get into Harvard if your parents went to Harvard, over and above mere class status. Since black people were under-represented in this category, people came up with the idea of putting a thumb on the other side of the scale and artificially increasing their rate of admission. Can it balance exactly against the disadvantages of discrimination? No. >; I genuinely don&#39;t get why the race thing is part of the equation. Shouldn&#39;t this just be run-of-the-mill social democratic &quot;lets hand out some extra opportunities/benefits to the poor&quot; program?

Affirmative Action probably helped my father, whose father was a construction worker and mother a homemaker both of whom dropped out of high school, get into college and ultimately become a doctor. But because my father was a doctor, I had a fairly privileged upbringing. I&#39;m a generation removed, but growing up in California always had to indicate my background on standardized tests and always checked &quot;White&quot; for race and then &quot;Hispanic&quot; for ethnicity (which is how all the tests asked it in those days, not sure if it&#39;s still the case), without thinking much about it.

But it also feels totally irrelevant to me, personally, because of my upper class upbringing and elite education, and I feel like I&#39;ve never really been discriminated against. Though I possibly have been discriminated &quot;for&quot;, and benefited tremendously from it. So I don&#39;t know how I feel about this change. It&#39;s certainly a big one, but in the long run, maybe it&#39;s good?

And advertisement is the rich asking for more money. A man would be annoyed if he found himself in a mob of millionaires, all holding out their silk hats for a penny; or all shouting with one voice, “Give me money.” Yet advertisement does really assault the eye very much as such a shout would assault the ear. “Budge&#39;s Boots are the Best” simply means “Give me money”; “Use Seraphic Soap” simply means “Give me money.” It is a complete mistake to suppose that common people make our towns commonplace, with unsightly things like advertisements. Most of those whose wares are thus placarded everywhere are very wealthy gentlemen with coronets and country seats, men who are probably very particular about the artistic adornment of their own homes. They disfigure their towns in order to decorate their houses. — GK Chesterton, <i>The New Jersusalem</i> <a href="http://www.gkc.org.uk/gkc/books/GKC_New_Jerusalem.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.gkc.org.uk/gkc/books/GKC_New_Jerusalem.html</a> ]]>; Fri, 30 Jun 2023 16:11:03 +0000</span> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 lolinder https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 I block ads because they&#39;re psychological warfare that corporations wage against me. I don&#39;t care how unobtrusive the ads are. I don&#39;t care if the ads don&#39;t track me.

I have zero tolerance for ads of any sort. Advertisers have no morals, they&#39;re completely depraved. They&#39;ll eagerly exploit a teenager&#39;s self-conscious body issues to sell useless beauty products.

It&#39;s because they&#39;ve become increasingly obnoxious. Nobody blocked ads when they were a simple column of links in the gutter or maybe an animated GIF banner with 3 frames. No, adblockers became popular because ads kept getting more loud (both visually and audibly), in your face, and resource hungry (remember those flash ads that&#39;d keep your CPU pegged?).

Some of those descendants are very successful now and some descendants of slave owners are probably very poor now. And some people are descendants of both. And then I learn about the Jim Crow period, and then you hear that even the GI bill explicitly excluded black people, and lynchings into the 1950s, and the extremely hard fight the civil rights movement had, and even legal discrimination up to 1971, not to mention tons of possibly illegal but still very real discrimination after that. And then I think: you can&#39;t just stop doing a bad thing and pretend it didn&#39;t happen. You&#39;ve got to try to make things right. Have things been made right by now? I have no idea. I do know plenty of black people still live in fear of the police, and that when black people call the police, there&#39;s the non-zero chance that they&#39;re the ones who end up getting shot. Not to mention that many universities also have affirmative action for children of alumni, who are still predominantly white and rich, partially because of the legal discrimination uo to 1971, and partially because universities are ridiculously expensive. Has that affirmative action also been struck down? >; America is not in the least social-democratic, It used to be, though.

Right? I mean, I can get behind that. But then why the entire detour with race? Up until about 1971 (possibly later, but that&#39;s the date of <i>Loving vs Virginia</i> ), the US had formal, legal discrimination against black people. On finally removing that, there was at various times discussion of whether people who had been legally discriminated against all their lives should be compensated, as if they had been wronged in a tort sense. This would obviously be extremely expensive, and anyway impossible to quantify, so it never happened. Harvard, and many other colleges, has a big base of &quot;legacy&quot; admissions, as well as a certain amount of generational knowledge and connections - you&#39;re more likely to get into Harvard if your parents went to Harvard, over and above mere class status. Since black people were under-represented in this category, people came up with the idea of putting a thumb on the other side of the scale and artificially increasing their rate of admission. Can it balance exactly against the disadvantages of discrimination? No. >; I genuinely don&#39;t get why the race thing is part of the equation. Shouldn&#39;t this just be run-of-the-mill social democratic &quot;lets hand out some extra opportunities/benefits to the poor&quot; program? America is not in the least social-democratic, but racism and anti-racism have been there since the beginning and will probably dominate US politics until the last person who remembers the KKK is dead.

Affirmative Action probably helped my father, whose father was a construction worker and mother a homemaker both of whom dropped out of high school, get into college and ultimately become a doctor. But because my father was a doctor, I had a fairly privileged upbringing. I&#39;m a generation removed, but growing up in California always had to indicate my background on standardized tests and always checked &quot;White&quot; for race and then &quot;Hispanic&quot; for ethnicity (which is how all the tests asked it in those days, not sure if it&#39;s still the case), without thinking much about it.

But it also feels totally irrelevant to me, personally, because of my upper class upbringing and elite education, and I feel like I&#39;ve never really been discriminated against. Though I possibly have been discriminated &quot;for&quot;, and benefited tremendously from it. So I don&#39;t know how I feel about this change. It&#39;s certainly a big one, but in the long run, maybe it&#39;s good?

And advertisement is the rich asking for more money. A man would be annoyed if he found himself in a mob of millionaires, all holding out their silk hats for a penny; or all shouting with one voice, “Give me money.” Yet advertisement does really assault the eye very much as such a shout would assault the ear. “Budge&#39;s Boots are the Best” simply means “Give me money”; “Use Seraphic Soap” simply means “Give me money.” It is a complete mistake to suppose that common people make our towns commonplace, with unsightly things like advertisements. Most of those whose wares are thus placarded everywhere are very wealthy gentlemen with coronets and country seats, men who are probably very particular about the artistic adornment of their own homes. They disfigure their towns in order to decorate their houses. — GK Chesterton, <i>The New Jersusalem</i> <a href="http://www.gkc.org.uk/gkc/books/GKC_New_Jerusalem.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.gkc.org.uk/gkc/books/GKC_New_Jerusalem.html</a> ]]>; Fri, 30 Jun 2023 16:11:03 +0000</span> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 lolinder https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 I block ads because they&#39;re psychological warfare that corporations wage against me. I don&#39;t care how unobtrusive the ads are. I don&#39;t care if the ads don&#39;t track me.

I have zero tolerance for ads of any sort. Advertisers have no morals, they&#39;re completely depraved. They&#39;ll eagerly exploit a teenager&#39;s self-conscious body issues to sell useless beauty products.

It&#39;s because they&#39;ve become increasingly obnoxious. Nobody blocked ads when they were a simple column of links in the gutter or maybe an animated GIF banner with 3 frames. No, adblockers became popular because ads kept getting more loud (both visually and audibly), in your face, and resource hungry (remember those flash ads that&#39;d keep your CPU pegged?).

Some of those descendants are very successful now and some descendants of slave owners are probably very poor now. And some people are descendants of both. And then I learn about the Jim Crow period, and then you hear that even the GI bill explicitly excluded black people, and lynchings into the 1950s, and the extremely hard fight the civil rights movement had, and even legal discrimination up to 1971, not to mention tons of possibly illegal but still very real discrimination after that. And then I think: you can&#39;t just stop doing a bad thing and pretend it didn&#39;t happen. You&#39;ve got to try to make things right. Have things been made right by now? I have no idea. I do know plenty of black people still live in fear of the police, and that when black people call the police, there&#39;s the non-zero chance that they&#39;re the ones who end up getting shot. Not to mention that many universities also have affirmative action for children of alumni, who are still predominantly white and rich, partially because of the legal discrimination uo to 1971, and partially because universities are ridiculously expensive. Has that affirmative action also been struck down? >; America is not in the least social-democratic, It used to be, though.

Right? I mean, I can get behind that. But then why the entire detour with race? Up until about 1971 (possibly later, but that&#39;s the date of <i>Loving vs Virginia</i> ), the US had formal, legal discrimination against black people. On finally removing that, there was at various times discussion of whether people who had been legally discriminated against all their lives should be compensated, as if they had been wronged in a tort sense. This would obviously be extremely expensive, and anyway impossible to quantify, so it never happened. Harvard, and many other colleges, has a big base of &quot;legacy&quot; admissions, as well as a certain amount of generational knowledge and connections - you&#39;re more likely to get into Harvard if your parents went to Harvard, over and above mere class status. Since black people were under-represented in this category, people came up with the idea of putting a thumb on the other side of the scale and artificially increasing their rate of admission. Can it balance exactly against the disadvantages of discrimination? No. >; I genuinely don&#39;t get why the race thing is part of the equation. Shouldn&#39;t this just be run-of-the-mill social democratic &quot;lets hand out some extra opportunities/benefits to the poor&quot; program? America is not in the least social-democratic, but racism and anti-racism have been there since the beginning and will probably dominate US politics until the last person who remembers the KKK is dead.

Affirmative Action probably helped my father, whose father was a construction worker and mother a homemaker both of whom dropped out of high school, get into college and ultimately become a doctor.

But it also feels totally irrelevant to me, personally, because of my upper class upbringing and elite education, and I feel like I&#39;ve never really been discriminated against. Though I possibly have been discriminated &quot;for&quot;, and benefited tremendously from it. So I don&#39;t know how I feel about this change. It&#39;s certainly a big one, but in the long run, maybe it&#39;s good?

And advertisement is the rich asking for more money. A man would be annoyed if he found himself in a mob of millionaires, all holding out their silk hats for a penny; or all shouting with one voice, “Give me money.” Yet advertisement does really assault the eye very much as such a shout would assault the ear. “Budge&#39;s Boots are the Best” simply means “Give me money”; “Use Seraphic Soap” simply means “Give me money.” It is a complete mistake to suppose that common people make our towns commonplace, with unsightly things like advertisements. Most of those whose wares are thus placarded everywhere are very wealthy gentlemen with coronets and country seats, men who are probably very particular about the artistic adornment of their own homes.

It&#39;s because they&#39;ve become increasingly obnoxious. Nobody blocked ads when they were a simple column of links in the gutter or maybe an animated GIF banner with 3 frames. No, adblockers became popular because ads kept getting more loud (both visually and audibly), in your face, and resource hungry (remember those flash ads that&#39;d keep your CPU pegged?).

Some of those descendants are very successful now and some descendants of slave owners are probably very poor now. And some people are descendants of both. And then I learn about the Jim Crow period, and then you hear that even the GI bill explicitly excluded black people, and lynchings into the 1950s, and the extremely hard fight the civil rights movement had, and even legal discrimination up to 1971, not to mention tons of possibly illegal but still very real discrimination after that. And then I think: you can&#39;t just stop doing a bad thing and pretend it didn&#39;t happen. You&#39;ve got to try to make things right. Have things been made right by now? I have no idea. I do know plenty of black people still live in fear of the police, and that when black people call the police, there&#39;s the non-zero chance that they&#39;re the ones who end up getting shot. Not to mention that many universities also have affirmative action for children of alumni, who are still predominantly white and rich, partially because of the legal discrimination uo to 1971, and partially because universities are ridiculously expensive. Has that affirmative action also been struck down? >; America is not in the least social-democratic, It used to be, though.

Right? I mean, I can get behind that. But then why the entire detour with race? Up until about 1971 (possibly later, but that&#39;s the date of <i>Loving vs Virginia</i> ), the US had formal, legal discrimination against black people. On finally removing that, there was at various times discussion of whether people who had been legally discriminated against all their lives should be compensated, as if they had been wronged in a tort sense. This would obviously be extremely expensive, and anyway impossible to quantify, so it never happened. Harvard, and many other colleges, has a big base of &quot;legacy&quot; admissions, as well as a certain amount of generational knowledge and connections - you&#39;re more likely to get into Harvard if your parents went to Harvard, over and above mere class status. Since black people were under-represented in this category, people came up with the idea of putting a thumb on the other side of the scale and artificially increasing their rate of admission. Can it balance exactly against the disadvantages of discrimination? No. >; I genuinely don&#39;t get why the race thing is part of the equation. Shouldn&#39;t this just be run-of-the-mill social democratic &quot;lets hand out some extra opportunities/benefits to the poor&quot; program?

Affirmative Action probably helped my father, whose father was a construction worker and mother a homemaker both of whom dropped out of high school, get into college and ultimately become a doctor.

But it also feels totally irrelevant to me, personally, because of my upper class upbringing and elite education, and I feel like I&#39;ve never really been discriminated against. Though I possibly have been discriminated &quot;for&quot;, and benefited tremendously from it. So I don&#39;t know how I feel about this change. It&#39;s certainly a big one, but in the long run, maybe it&#39;s good?

And advertisement is the rich asking for more money. A man would be annoyed if he found himself in a mob of millionaires, all holding out their silk hats for a penny; or all shouting with one voice, “Give me money.” Yet advertisement does really assault the eye very much as such a shout would assault the ear. “Budge&#39;s Boots are the Best” simply means “Give me money”; “Use Seraphic Soap” simply means “Give me money.” It is a complete mistake to suppose that common people make our towns commonplace, with unsightly things like advertisements. Most of those whose wares are thus placarded everywhere are very wealthy gentlemen with coronets and country seats, men who are probably very particular about the artistic adornment of their own homes.

It&#39;s because they&#39;ve become increasingly obnoxious. Nobody blocked ads when they were a simple column of links in the gutter or maybe an animated GIF banner with 3 frames. No, adblockers became popular because ads kept getting more loud (both visually and audibly), in your face, and resource hungry (remember those flash ads that&#39;d keep your CPU pegged?).

Some of those descendants are very successful now and some descendants of slave owners are probably very poor now. And some people are descendants of both. And then I learn about the Jim Crow period, and then you hear that even the GI bill explicitly excluded black people, and lynchings into the 1950s, and the extremely hard fight the civil rights movement had, and even legal discrimination up to 1971, not to mention tons of possibly illegal but still very real discrimination after that. And then I think: you can&#39;t just stop doing a bad thing and pretend it didn&#39;t happen. You&#39;ve got to try to make things right. Have things been made right by now? I have no idea. I do know plenty of black people still live in fear of the police, and that when black people call the police, there&#39;s the non-zero chance that they&#39;re the ones who end up getting shot. Not to mention that many universities also have affirmative action for children of alumni, who are still predominantly white and rich, partially because of the legal discrimination uo to 1971, and partially because universities are ridiculously expensive. Has that affirmative action also been struck down? >; America is not in the least social-democratic, It used to be, though.

Right? I mean, I can get behind that. But then why the entire detour with race? Up until about 1971 (possibly later, but that&#39;s the date of <i>Loving vs Virginia</i> ), the US had formal, legal discrimination against black people. On finally removing that, there was at various times discussion of whether people who had been legally discriminated against all their lives should be compensated, as if they had been wronged in a tort sense. This would obviously be extremely expensive, and anyway impossible to quantify, so it never happened. Harvard, and many other colleges, has a big base of &quot;legacy&quot; admissions, as well as a certain amount of generational knowledge and connections - you&#39;re more likely to get into Harvard if your parents went to Harvard, over and above mere class status. Since black people were under-represented in this category, people came up with the idea of putting a thumb on the other side of the scale and artificially increasing their rate of admission. Can it balance exactly against the disadvantages of discrimination? No. >; I genuinely don&#39;t get why the race thing is part of the equation. Shouldn&#39;t this just be run-of-the-mill social democratic &quot;lets hand out some extra opportunities/benefits to the poor&quot; program?

Affirmative Action probably helped my father, whose father was a construction worker and mother a homemaker both of whom dropped out of high school, get into college and ultimately become a doctor. But because my father was a doctor, I had a fairly privileged upbringing. I&#39;m a generation removed, but growing up in California always had to indicate my background on standardized tests and always checked &quot;White&quot; for race and then &quot;Hispanic&quot; for ethnicity (which is how all the tests asked it in those days, not sure if it&#39;s still the case), without thinking much about it.

But it also feels totally irrelevant to me, personally, because of my upper class upbringing and elite education, and I feel like I&#39;ve never really been discriminated against. Though I possibly have been discriminated &quot;for&quot;, and benefited tremendously from it. So I don&#39;t know how I feel about this change. It&#39;s certainly a big one, but in the long run, maybe it&#39;s good?

And advertisement is the rich asking for more money. A man would be annoyed if he found himself in a mob of millionaires, all holding out their silk hats for a penny; or all shouting with one voice, “Give me money.” Yet advertisement does really assault the eye very much as such a shout would assault the ear. “Budge&#39;s Boots are the Best” simply means “Give me money”; “Use Seraphic Soap” simply means “Give me money.” It is a complete mistake to suppose that common people make our towns commonplace, with unsightly things like advertisements. Most of those whose wares are thus placarded everywhere are very wealthy gentlemen with coronets and country seats, men who are probably very particular about the artistic adornment of their own homes. They disfigure their towns in order to decorate their houses. — GK Chesterton, <i>The New Jersusalem</i> <a href="http://www.gkc.org.uk/gkc/books/GKC_New_Jerusalem.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.gkc.org.uk/gkc/books/GKC_New_Jerusalem.html</a> ]]>; Fri, 30 Jun 2023 16:11:03 +0000</span> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 lolinder https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 I block ads because they&#39;re psychological warfare that corporations wage against me. I don&#39;t care how unobtrusive the ads are. I don&#39;t care if the ads don&#39;t track me.

I have zero tolerance for ads of any sort. Advertisers have no morals, they&#39;re completely depraved. They&#39;ll eagerly exploit a teenager&#39;s self-conscious body issues to sell useless beauty products.

It&#39;s because they&#39;ve become increasingly obnoxious. Nobody blocked ads when they were a simple column of links in the gutter or maybe an animated GIF banner with 3 frames. No, adblockers became popular because ads kept getting more loud (both visually and audibly), in your face, and resource hungry (remember those flash ads that&#39;d keep your CPU pegged?).

Some of those descendants are very successful now and some descendants of slave owners are probably very poor now. And some people are descendants of both. And then I learn about the Jim Crow period, and then you hear that even the GI bill explicitly excluded black people, and lynchings into the 1950s, and the extremely hard fight the civil rights movement had, and even legal discrimination up to 1971, not to mention tons of possibly illegal but still very real discrimination after that. And then I think: you can&#39;t just stop doing a bad thing and pretend it didn&#39;t happen. You&#39;ve got to try to make things right. Have things been made right by now? I have no idea. I do know plenty of black people still live in fear of the police, and that when black people call the police, there&#39;s the non-zero chance that they&#39;re the ones who end up getting shot. Not to mention that many universities also have affirmative action for children of alumni, who are still predominantly white and rich, partially because of the legal discrimination uo to 1971, and partially because universities are ridiculously expensive. Has that affirmative action also been struck down? >; America is not in the least social-democratic, It used to be, though.

Right? I mean, I can get behind that. But then why the entire detour with race? Up until about 1971 (possibly later, but that&#39;s the date of <i>Loving vs Virginia</i> ), the US had formal, legal discrimination against black people. On finally removing that, there was at various times discussion of whether people who had been legally discriminated against all their lives should be compensated, as if they had been wronged in a tort sense. This would obviously be extremely expensive, and anyway impossible to quantify, so it never happened. Harvard, and many other colleges, has a big base of &quot;legacy&quot; admissions, as well as a certain amount of generational knowledge and connections - you&#39;re more likely to get into Harvard if your parents went to Harvard, over and above mere class status. Since black people were under-represented in this category, people came up with the idea of putting a thumb on the other side of the scale and artificially increasing their rate of admission. Can it balance exactly against the disadvantages of discrimination? No. >; I genuinely don&#39;t get why the race thing is part of the equation. Shouldn&#39;t this just be run-of-the-mill social democratic &quot;lets hand out some extra opportunities/benefits to the poor&quot; program? America is not in the least social-democratic, but racism and anti-racism have been there since the beginning and will probably dominate US politics until the last person who remembers the KKK is dead.

Affirmative Action probably helped my father, whose father was a construction worker and mother a homemaker both of whom dropped out of high school, get into college and ultimately become a doctor. But because my father was a doctor, I had a fairly privileged upbringing. I&#39;m a generation removed, but growing up in California always had to indicate my background on standardized tests and always checked &quot;White&quot; for race and then &quot;Hispanic&quot; for ethnicity (which is how all the tests asked it in those days, not sure if it&#39;s still the case), without thinking much about it.

But it also feels totally irrelevant to me, personally, because of my upper class upbringing and elite education, and I feel like I&#39;ve never really been discriminated against. Though I possibly have been discriminated &quot;for&quot;, and benefited tremendously from it. So I don&#39;t know how I feel about this change. It&#39;s certainly a big one, but in the long run, maybe it&#39;s good?

And advertisement is the rich asking for more money. A man would be annoyed if he found himself in a mob of millionaires, all holding out their silk hats for a penny; or all shouting with one voice, “Give me money.” Yet advertisement does really assault the eye very much as such a shout would assault the ear. “Budge&#39;s Boots are the Best” simply means “Give me money”; “Use Seraphic Soap” simply means “Give me money.” It is a complete mistake to suppose that common people make our towns commonplace, with unsightly things like advertisements. Most of those whose wares are thus placarded everywhere are very wealthy gentlemen with coronets and country seats, men who are probably very particular about the artistic adornment of their own homes. They disfigure their towns in order to decorate their houses. — GK Chesterton, <i>The New Jersusalem</i> <a href="http://www.gkc.org.uk/gkc/books/GKC_New_Jerusalem.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.gkc.org.uk/gkc/books/GKC_New_Jerusalem.html</a> ]]>; Fri, 30 Jun 2023 16:11:03 +0000</span> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 lolinder https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 I block ads because they&#39;re psychological warfare that corporations wage against me. I don&#39;t care how unobtrusive the ads are. I don&#39;t care if the ads don&#39;t track me.

I have zero tolerance for ads of any sort. Advertisers have no morals, they&#39;re completely depraved. They&#39;ll eagerly exploit a teenager&#39;s self-conscious body issues to sell useless beauty products.

It&#39;s because they&#39;ve become increasingly obnoxious. Nobody blocked ads when they were a simple column of links in the gutter or maybe an animated GIF banner with 3 frames. No, adblockers became popular because ads kept getting more loud (both visually and audibly), in your face, and resource hungry (remember those flash ads that&#39;d keep your CPU pegged?).

Some of those descendants are very successful now and some descendants of slave owners are probably very poor now. And some people are descendants of both. And then I learn about the Jim Crow period, and then you hear that even the GI bill explicitly excluded black people, and lynchings into the 1950s, and the extremely hard fight the civil rights movement had, and even legal discrimination up to 1971, not to mention tons of possibly illegal but still very real discrimination after that. And then I think: you can&#39;t just stop doing a bad thing and pretend it didn&#39;t happen. You&#39;ve got to try to make things right. Have things been made right by now? I have no idea. I do know plenty of black people still live in fear of the police, and that when black people call the police, there&#39;s the non-zero chance that they&#39;re the ones who end up getting shot. Not to mention that many universities also have affirmative action for children of alumni, who are still predominantly white and rich, partially because of the legal discrimination uo to 1971, and partially because universities are ridiculously expensive. Has that affirmative action also been struck down? >; America is not in the least social-democratic, It used to be, though.

Right? I mean, I can get behind that. But then why the entire detour with race? Up until about 1971 (possibly later, but that&#39;s the date of <i>Loving vs Virginia</i> ), the US had formal, legal discrimination against black people. On finally removing that, there was at various times discussion of whether people who had been legally discriminated against all their lives should be compensated, as if they had been wronged in a tort sense. This would obviously be extremely expensive, and anyway impossible to quantify, so it never happened. Harvard, and many other colleges, has a big base of &quot;legacy&quot; admissions, as well as a certain amount of generational knowledge and connections - you&#39;re more likely to get into Harvard if your parents went to Harvard, over and above mere class status. Since black people were under-represented in this category, people came up with the idea of putting a thumb on the other side of the scale and artificially increasing their rate of admission. Can it balance exactly against the disadvantages of discrimination? No. >; I genuinely don&#39;t get why the race thing is part of the equation. Shouldn&#39;t this just be run-of-the-mill social democratic &quot;lets hand out some extra opportunities/benefits to the poor&quot; program? America is not in the least social-democratic, but racism and anti-racism have been there since the beginning and will probably dominate US politics until the last person who remembers the KKK is dead.

Affirmative Action probably helped my father, whose father was a construction worker and mother a homemaker both of whom dropped out of high school, get into college and ultimately become a doctor.

But it also feels totally irrelevant to me, personally, because of my upper class upbringing and elite education, and I feel like I&#39;ve never really been discriminated against. Though I possibly have been discriminated &quot;for&quot;, and benefited tremendously from it. So I don&#39;t know how I feel about this change. It&#39;s certainly a big one, but in the long run, maybe it&#39;s good?

And advertisement is the rich asking for more money. A man would be annoyed if he found himself in a mob of millionaires, all holding out their silk hats for a penny; or all shouting with one voice, “Give me money.” Yet advertisement does really assault the eye very much as such a shout would assault the ear. “Budge&#39;s Boots are the Best” simply means “Give me money”; “Use Seraphic Soap” simply means “Give me money.” It is a complete mistake to suppose that common people make our towns commonplace, with unsightly things like advertisements. Most of those whose wares are thus placarded everywhere are very wealthy gentlemen with coronets and country seats, men who are probably very particular about the artistic adornment of their own homes.

It&#39;s because they&#39;ve become increasingly obnoxious. Nobody blocked ads when they were a simple column of links in the gutter or maybe an animated GIF banner with 3 frames. No, adblockers became popular because ads kept getting more loud (both visually and audibly), in your face, and resource hungry (remember those flash ads that&#39;d keep your CPU pegged?).

Some of those descendants are very successful now and some descendants of slave owners are probably very poor now. And some people are descendants of both. And then I learn about the Jim Crow period, and then you hear that even the GI bill explicitly excluded black people, and lynchings into the 1950s, and the extremely hard fight the civil rights movement had, and even legal discrimination up to 1971, not to mention tons of possibly illegal but still very real discrimination after that. And then I think: you can&#39;t just stop doing a bad thing and pretend it didn&#39;t happen. You&#39;ve got to try to make things right. Have things been made right by now? I have no idea. I do know plenty of black people still live in fear of the police, and that when black people call the police, there&#39;s the non-zero chance that they&#39;re the ones who end up getting shot. Not to mention that many universities also have affirmative action for children of alumni, who are still predominantly white and rich, partially because of the legal discrimination uo to 1971, and partially because universities are ridiculously expensive. Has that affirmative action also been struck down? >; America is not in the least social-democratic, It used to be, though.

Right? I mean, I can get behind that. But then why the entire detour with race? Up until about 1971 (possibly later, but that&#39;s the date of <i>Loving vs Virginia</i> ), the US had formal, legal discrimination against black people. On finally removing that, there was at various times discussion of whether people who had been legally discriminated against all their lives should be compensated, as if they had been wronged in a tort sense. This would obviously be extremely expensive, and anyway impossible to quantify, so it never happened. Harvard, and many other colleges, has a big base of &quot;legacy&quot; admissions, as well as a certain amount of generational knowledge and connections - you&#39;re more likely to get into Harvard if your parents went to Harvard, over and above mere class status. Since black people were under-represented in this category, people came up with the idea of putting a thumb on the other side of the scale and artificially increasing their rate of admission. Can it balance exactly against the disadvantages of discrimination? No. >; I genuinely don&#39;t get why the race thing is part of the equation. Shouldn&#39;t this just be run-of-the-mill social democratic &quot;lets hand out some extra opportunities/benefits to the poor&quot; program?

Affirmative Action probably helped my father, whose father was a construction worker and mother a homemaker both of whom dropped out of high school, get into college and ultimately become a doctor.

But it also feels totally irrelevant to me, personally, because of my upper class upbringing and elite education, and I feel like I&#39;ve never really been discriminated against. Though I possibly have been discriminated &quot;for&quot;, and benefited tremendously from it. So I don&#39;t know how I feel about this change. It&#39;s certainly a big one, but in the long run, maybe it&#39;s good?

And advertisement is the rich asking for more money. A man would be annoyed if he found himself in a mob of millionaires, all holding out their silk hats for a penny; or all shouting with one voice, “Give me money.” Yet advertisement does really assault the eye very much as such a shout would assault the ear. “Budge&#39;s Boots are the Best” simply means “Give me money”; “Use Seraphic Soap” simply means “Give me money.” It is a complete mistake to suppose that common people make our towns commonplace, with unsightly things like advertisements. Most of those whose wares are thus placarded everywhere are very wealthy gentlemen with coronets and country seats, men who are probably very particular about the artistic adornment of their own homes.

It&#39;s because they&#39;ve become increasingly obnoxious. Nobody blocked ads when they were a simple column of links in the gutter or maybe an animated GIF banner with 3 frames. No, adblockers became popular because ads kept getting more loud (both visually and audibly), in your face, and resource hungry (remember those flash ads that&#39;d keep your CPU pegged?).

Some of those descendants are very successful now and some descendants of slave owners are probably very poor now. And some people are descendants of both. And then I learn about the Jim Crow period, and then you hear that even the GI bill explicitly excluded black people, and lynchings into the 1950s, and the extremely hard fight the civil rights movement had, and even legal discrimination up to 1971, not to mention tons of possibly illegal but still very real discrimination after that. And then I think: you can&#39;t just stop doing a bad thing and pretend it didn&#39;t happen. You&#39;ve got to try to make things right. Have things been made right by now? I have no idea. I do know plenty of black people still live in fear of the police, and that when black people call the police, there&#39;s the non-zero chance that they&#39;re the ones who end up getting shot. Not to mention that many universities also have affirmative action for children of alumni, who are still predominantly white and rich, partially because of the legal discrimination uo to 1971, and partially because universities are ridiculously expensive. Has that affirmative action also been struck down? >; America is not in the least social-democratic, It used to be, though.

Right? I mean, I can get behind that. But then why the entire detour with race? Up until about 1971 (possibly later, but that&#39;s the date of <i>Loving vs Virginia</i> ), the US had formal, legal discrimination against black people. On finally removing that, there was at various times discussion of whether people who had been legally discriminated against all their lives should be compensated, as if they had been wronged in a tort sense. This would obviously be extremely expensive, and anyway impossible to quantify, so it never happened. Harvard, and many other colleges, has a big base of &quot;legacy&quot; admissions, as well as a certain amount of generational knowledge and connections - you&#39;re more likely to get into Harvard if your parents went to Harvard, over and above mere class status. Since black people were under-represented in this category, people came up with the idea of putting a thumb on the other side of the scale and artificially increasing their rate of admission. Can it balance exactly against the disadvantages of discrimination? No. >; I genuinely don&#39;t get why the race thing is part of the equation. Shouldn&#39;t this just be run-of-the-mill social democratic &quot;lets hand out some extra opportunities/benefits to the poor&quot; program?

Affirmative Action probably helped my father, whose father was a construction worker and mother a homemaker both of whom dropped out of high school, get into college and ultimately become a doctor. But because my father was a doctor, I had a fairly privileged upbringing. I&#39;m a generation removed, but growing up in California always had to indicate my background on standardized tests and always checked &quot;White&quot; for race and then &quot;Hispanic&quot; for ethnicity (which is how all the tests asked it in those days, not sure if it&#39;s still the case), without thinking much about it.

But it also feels totally irrelevant to me, personally, because of my upper class upbringing and elite education, and I feel like I&#39;ve never really been discriminated against. Though I possibly have been discriminated &quot;for&quot;, and benefited tremendously from it. So I don&#39;t know how I feel about this change. It&#39;s certainly a big one, but in the long run, maybe it&#39;s good?

And advertisement is the rich asking for more money. A man would be annoyed if he found himself in a mob of millionaires, all holding out their silk hats for a penny; or all shouting with one voice, “Give me money.” Yet advertisement does really assault the eye very much as such a shout would assault the ear. “Budge&#39;s Boots are the Best” simply means “Give me money”; “Use Seraphic Soap” simply means “Give me money.” It is a complete mistake to suppose that common people make our towns commonplace, with unsightly things like advertisements. Most of those whose wares are thus placarded everywhere are very wealthy gentlemen with coronets and country seats, men who are probably very particular about the artistic adornment of their own homes. They disfigure their towns in order to decorate their houses. — GK Chesterton, <i>The New Jersusalem</i> <a href="http://www.gkc.org.uk/gkc/books/GKC_New_Jerusalem.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.gkc.org.uk/gkc/books/GKC_New_Jerusalem.html</a> ]]>; Fri, 30 Jun 2023 16:11:03 +0000</span> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 lolinder https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 I block ads because they&#39;re psychological warfare that corporations wage against me. I don&#39;t care how unobtrusive the ads are. I don&#39;t care if the ads don&#39;t track me.

I have zero tolerance for ads of any sort. Advertisers have no morals, they&#39;re completely depraved. They&#39;ll eagerly exploit a teenager&#39;s self-conscious body issues to sell useless beauty products.

It&#39;s because they&#39;ve become increasingly obnoxious. Nobody blocked ads when they were a simple column of links in the gutter or maybe an animated GIF banner with 3 frames. No, adblockers became popular because ads kept getting more loud (both visually and audibly), in your face, and resource hungry (remember those flash ads that&#39;d keep your CPU pegged?).

Some of those descendants are very successful now and some descendants of slave owners are probably very poor now. And some people are descendants of both. And then I learn about the Jim Crow period, and then you hear that even the GI bill explicitly excluded black people, and lynchings into the 1950s, and the extremely hard fight the civil rights movement had, and even legal discrimination up to 1971, not to mention tons of possibly illegal but still very real discrimination after that. And then I think: you can&#39;t just stop doing a bad thing and pretend it didn&#39;t happen. You&#39;ve got to try to make things right. Have things been made right by now? I have no idea. I do know plenty of black people still live in fear of the police, and that when black people call the police, there&#39;s the non-zero chance that they&#39;re the ones who end up getting shot. Not to mention that many universities also have affirmative action for children of alumni, who are still predominantly white and rich, partially because of the legal discrimination uo to 1971, and partially because universities are ridiculously expensive. Has that affirmative action also been struck down? >; America is not in the least social-democratic, It used to be, though.

Right? I mean, I can get behind that. But then why the entire detour with race? Up until about 1971 (possibly later, but that&#39;s the date of <i>Loving vs Virginia</i> ), the US had formal, legal discrimination against black people. On finally removing that, there was at various times discussion of whether people who had been legally discriminated against all their lives should be compensated, as if they had been wronged in a tort sense. This would obviously be extremely expensive, and anyway impossible to quantify, so it never happened. Harvard, and many other colleges, has a big base of &quot;legacy&quot; admissions, as well as a certain amount of generational knowledge and connections - you&#39;re more likely to get into Harvard if your parents went to Harvard, over and above mere class status. Since black people were under-represented in this category, people came up with the idea of putting a thumb on the other side of the scale and artificially increasing their rate of admission. Can it balance exactly against the disadvantages of discrimination? No. >; I genuinely don&#39;t get why the race thing is part of the equation. Shouldn&#39;t this just be run-of-the-mill social democratic &quot;lets hand out some extra opportunities/benefits to the poor&quot; program? America is not in the least social-democratic, but racism and anti-racism have been there since the beginning and will probably dominate US politics until the last person who remembers the KKK is dead.

Affirmative Action probably helped my father, whose father was a construction worker and mother a homemaker both of whom dropped out of high school, get into college and ultimately become a doctor. But because my father was a doctor, I had a fairly privileged upbringing. I&#39;m a generation removed, but growing up in California always had to indicate my background on standardized tests and always checked &quot;White&quot; for race and then &quot;Hispanic&quot; for ethnicity (which is how all the tests asked it in those days, not sure if it&#39;s still the case), without thinking much about it.

But it also feels totally irrelevant to me, personally, because of my upper class upbringing and elite education, and I feel like I&#39;ve never really been discriminated against. Though I possibly have been discriminated &quot;for&quot;, and benefited tremendously from it. So I don&#39;t know how I feel about this change. It&#39;s certainly a big one, but in the long run, maybe it&#39;s good?

And advertisement is the rich asking for more money. A man would be annoyed if he found himself in a mob of millionaires, all holding out their silk hats for a penny; or all shouting with one voice, “Give me money.” Yet advertisement does really assault the eye very much as such a shout would assault the ear. “Budge&#39;s Boots are the Best” simply means “Give me money”; “Use Seraphic Soap” simply means “Give me money.” It is a complete mistake to suppose that common people make our towns commonplace, with unsightly things like advertisements. Most of those whose wares are thus placarded everywhere are very wealthy gentlemen with coronets and country seats, men who are probably very particular about the artistic adornment of their own homes. They disfigure their towns in order to decorate their houses. — GK Chesterton, <i>The New Jersusalem</i> <a href="http://www.gkc.org.uk/gkc/books/GKC_New_Jerusalem.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.gkc.org.uk/gkc/books/GKC_New_Jerusalem.html</a> ]]>; Fri, 30 Jun 2023 16:11:03 +0000</span> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 lolinder https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 I block ads because they&#39;re psychological warfare that corporations wage against me. I don&#39;t care how unobtrusive the ads are. I don&#39;t care if the ads don&#39;t track me.

I have zero tolerance for ads of any sort. Advertisers have no morals, they&#39;re completely depraved. They&#39;ll eagerly exploit a teenager&#39;s self-conscious body issues to sell useless beauty products.

It&#39;s because they&#39;ve become increasingly obnoxious. Nobody blocked ads when they were a simple column of links in the gutter or maybe an animated GIF banner with 3 frames. No, adblockers became popular because ads kept getting more loud (both visually and audibly), in your face, and resource hungry (remember those flash ads that&#39;d keep your CPU pegged?).

Some of those descendants are very successful now and some descendants of slave owners are probably very poor now. And some people are descendants of both. And then I learn about the Jim Crow period, and then you hear that even the GI bill explicitly excluded black people, and lynchings into the 1950s, and the extremely hard fight the civil rights movement had, and even legal discrimination up to 1971, not to mention tons of possibly illegal but still very real discrimination after that. And then I think: you can&#39;t just stop doing a bad thing and pretend it didn&#39;t happen. You&#39;ve got to try to make things right. Have things been made right by now? I have no idea. I do know plenty of black people still live in fear of the police, and that when black people call the police, there&#39;s the non-zero chance that they&#39;re the ones who end up getting shot. Not to mention that many universities also have affirmative action for children of alumni, who are still predominantly white and rich, partially because of the legal discrimination uo to 1971, and partially because universities are ridiculously expensive. Has that affirmative action also been struck down? >; America is not in the least social-democratic, It used to be, though.

Right? I mean, I can get behind that. But then why the entire detour with race? Up until about 1971 (possibly later, but that&#39;s the date of <i>Loving vs Virginia</i> ), the US had formal, legal discrimination against black people. On finally removing that, there was at various times discussion of whether people who had been legally discriminated against all their lives should be compensated, as if they had been wronged in a tort sense. This would obviously be extremely expensive, and anyway impossible to quantify, so it never happened. Harvard, and many other colleges, has a big base of &quot;legacy&quot; admissions, as well as a certain amount of generational knowledge and connections - you&#39;re more likely to get into Harvard if your parents went to Harvard, over and above mere class status. Since black people were under-represented in this category, people came up with the idea of putting a thumb on the other side of the scale and artificially increasing their rate of admission. Can it balance exactly against the disadvantages of discrimination? No. >; I genuinely don&#39;t get why the race thing is part of the equation. Shouldn&#39;t this just be run-of-the-mill social democratic &quot;lets hand out some extra opportunities/benefits to the poor&quot; program? America is not in the least social-democratic, but racism and anti-racism have been there since the beginning and will probably dominate US politics until the last person who remembers the KKK is dead.

Affirmative Action probably helped my father, whose father was a construction worker and mother a homemaker both of whom dropped out of high school, get into college and ultimately become a doctor.

But it also feels totally irrelevant to me, personally, because of my upper class upbringing and elite education, and I feel like I&#39;ve never really been discriminated against. Though I possibly have been discriminated &quot;for&quot;, and benefited tremendously from it. So I don&#39;t know how I feel about this change. It&#39;s certainly a big one, but in the long run, maybe it&#39;s good?

And advertisement is the rich asking for more money. A man would be annoyed if he found himself in a mob of millionaires, all holding out their silk hats for a penny; or all shouting with one voice, “Give me money.” Yet advertisement does really assault the eye very much as such a shout would assault the ear. “Budge&#39;s Boots are the Best” simply means “Give me money”; “Use Seraphic Soap” simply means “Give me money.” It is a complete mistake to suppose that common people make our towns commonplace, with unsightly things like advertisements. Most of those whose wares are thus placarded everywhere are very wealthy gentlemen with coronets and country seats, men who are probably very particular about the artistic adornment of their own homes.

It&#39;s because they&#39;ve become increasingly obnoxious. Nobody blocked ads when they were a simple column of links in the gutter or maybe an animated GIF banner with 3 frames. No, adblockers became popular because ads kept getting more loud (both visually and audibly), in your face, and resource hungry (remember those flash ads that&#39;d keep your CPU pegged?).

Some of those descendants are very successful now and some descendants of slave owners are probably very poor now. And some people are descendants of both. And then I learn about the Jim Crow period, and then you hear that even the GI bill explicitly excluded black people, and lynchings into the 1950s, and the extremely hard fight the civil rights movement had, and even legal discrimination up to 1971, not to mention tons of possibly illegal but still very real discrimination after that. And then I think: you can&#39;t just stop doing a bad thing and pretend it didn&#39;t happen. You&#39;ve got to try to make things right. Have things been made right by now? I have no idea. I do know plenty of black people still live in fear of the police, and that when black people call the police, there&#39;s the non-zero chance that they&#39;re the ones who end up getting shot. Not to mention that many universities also have affirmative action for children of alumni, who are still predominantly white and rich, partially because of the legal discrimination uo to 1971, and partially because universities are ridiculously expensive. Has that affirmative action also been struck down? >; America is not in the least social-democratic, It used to be, though.

Right? I mean, I can get behind that. But then why the entire detour with race? Up until about 1971 (possibly later, but that&#39;s the date of <i>Loving vs Virginia</i> ), the US had formal, legal discrimination against black people. On finally removing that, there was at various times discussion of whether people who had been legally discriminated against all their lives should be compensated, as if they had been wronged in a tort sense. This would obviously be extremely expensive, and anyway impossible to quantify, so it never happened. Harvard, and many other colleges, has a big base of &quot;legacy&quot; admissions, as well as a certain amount of generational knowledge and connections - you&#39;re more likely to get into Harvard if your parents went to Harvard, over and above mere class status. Since black people were under-represented in this category, people came up with the idea of putting a thumb on the other side of the scale and artificially increasing their rate of admission. Can it balance exactly against the disadvantages of discrimination? No. >; I genuinely don&#39;t get why the race thing is part of the equation. Shouldn&#39;t this just be run-of-the-mill social democratic &quot;lets hand out some extra opportunities/benefits to the poor&quot; program?

Affirmative Action probably helped my father, whose father was a construction worker and mother a homemaker both of whom dropped out of high school, get into college and ultimately become a doctor. But because my father was a doctor, I had a fairly privileged upbringing. I&#39;m a generation removed, but growing up in California always had to indicate my background on standardized tests and always checked &quot;White&quot; for race and then &quot;Hispanic&quot; for ethnicity (which is how all the tests asked it in those days, not sure if it&#39;s still the case), without thinking much about it.

But it also feels totally irrelevant to me, personally, because of my upper class upbringing and elite education, and I feel like I&#39;ve never really been discriminated against. Though I possibly have been discriminated &quot;for&quot;, and benefited tremendously from it. So I don&#39;t know how I feel about this change. It&#39;s certainly a big one, but in the long run, maybe it&#39;s good?

And advertisement is the rich asking for more money. A man would be annoyed if he found himself in a mob of millionaires, all holding out their silk hats for a penny; or all shouting with one voice, “Give me money.” Yet advertisement does really assault the eye very much as such a shout would assault the ear. “Budge&#39;s Boots are the Best” simply means “Give me money”; “Use Seraphic Soap” simply means “Give me money.” It is a complete mistake to suppose that common people make our towns commonplace, with unsightly things like advertisements. Most of those whose wares are thus placarded everywhere are very wealthy gentlemen with coronets and country seats, men who are probably very particular about the artistic adornment of their own homes. They disfigure their towns in order to decorate their houses. — GK Chesterton, <i>The New Jersusalem</i> <a href="http://www.gkc.org.uk/gkc/books/GKC_New_Jerusalem.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.gkc.org.uk/gkc/books/GKC_New_Jerusalem.html</a> ]]>; Fri, 30 Jun 2023 16:11:03 +0000</span> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 lolinder https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 I block ads because they&#39;re psychological warfare that corporations wage against me. I don&#39;t care how unobtrusive the ads are. I don&#39;t care if the ads don&#39;t track me.

I have zero tolerance for ads of any sort. Advertisers have no morals, they&#39;re completely depraved. They&#39;ll eagerly exploit a teenager&#39;s self-conscious body issues to sell useless beauty products.

It&#39;s because they&#39;ve become increasingly obnoxious. Nobody blocked ads when they were a simple column of links in the gutter or maybe an animated GIF banner with 3 frames. No, adblockers became popular because ads kept getting more loud (both visually and audibly), in your face, and resource hungry (remember those flash ads that&#39;d keep your CPU pegged?).

Some of those descendants are very successful now and some descendants of slave owners are probably very poor now. And some people are descendants of both. And then I learn about the Jim Crow period, and then you hear that even the GI bill explicitly excluded black people, and lynchings into the 1950s, and the extremely hard fight the civil rights movement had, and even legal discrimination up to 1971, not to mention tons of possibly illegal but still very real discrimination after that. And then I think: you can&#39;t just stop doing a bad thing and pretend it didn&#39;t happen. You&#39;ve got to try to make things right. Have things been made right by now? I have no idea. I do know plenty of black people still live in fear of the police, and that when black people call the police, there&#39;s the non-zero chance that they&#39;re the ones who end up getting shot. Not to mention that many universities also have affirmative action for children of alumni, who are still predominantly white and rich, partially because of the legal discrimination uo to 1971, and partially because universities are ridiculously expensive. Has that affirmative action also been struck down? >; America is not in the least social-democratic, It used to be, though.

Right? I mean, I can get behind that. But then why the entire detour with race? Up until about 1971 (possibly later, but that&#39;s the date of <i>Loving vs Virginia</i> ), the US had formal, legal discrimination against black people. On finally removing that, there was at various times discussion of whether people who had been legally discriminated against all their lives should be compensated, as if they had been wronged in a tort sense. This would obviously be extremely expensive, and anyway impossible to quantify, so it never happened. Harvard, and many other colleges, has a big base of &quot;legacy&quot; admissions, as well as a certain amount of generational knowledge and connections - you&#39;re more likely to get into Harvard if your parents went to Harvard, over and above mere class status. Since black people were under-represented in this category, people came up with the idea of putting a thumb on the other side of the scale and artificially increasing their rate of admission. Can it balance exactly against the disadvantages of discrimination? No. >; I genuinely don&#39;t get why the race thing is part of the equation. Shouldn&#39;t this just be run-of-the-mill social democratic &quot;lets hand out some extra opportunities/benefits to the poor&quot; program? America is not in the least social-democratic, but racism and anti-racism have been there since the beginning and will probably dominate US politics until the last person who remembers the KKK is dead.

Affirmative Action probably helped my father, whose father was a construction worker and mother a homemaker both of whom dropped out of high school, get into college and ultimately become a doctor. But because my father was a doctor, I had a fairly privileged upbringing. I&#39;m a generation removed, but growing up in California always had to indicate my background on standardized tests and always checked &quot;White&quot; for race and then &quot;Hispanic&quot; for ethnicity (which is how all the tests asked it in those days, not sure if it&#39;s still the case), without thinking much about it.

But it also feels totally irrelevant to me, personally, because of my upper class upbringing and elite education, and I feel like I&#39;ve never really been discriminated against. Though I possibly have been discriminated &quot;for&quot;, and benefited tremendously from it. So I don&#39;t know how I feel about this change. It&#39;s certainly a big one, but in the long run, maybe it&#39;s good?

And advertisement is the rich asking for more money. A man would be annoyed if he found himself in a mob of millionaires, all holding out their silk hats for a penny; or all shouting with one voice, “Give me money.” Yet advertisement does really assault the eye very much as such a shout would assault the ear. “Budge&#39;s Boots are the Best” simply means “Give me money”; “Use Seraphic Soap” simply means “Give me money.” It is a complete mistake to suppose that common people make our towns commonplace, with unsightly things like advertisements. Most of those whose wares are thus placarded everywhere are very wealthy gentlemen with coronets and country seats, men who are probably very particular about the artistic adornment of their own homes. They disfigure their towns in order to decorate their houses. — GK Chesterton, <i>The New Jersusalem</i> <a href="http://www.gkc.org.uk/gkc/books/GKC_New_Jerusalem.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.gkc.org.uk/gkc/books/GKC_New_Jerusalem.html</a> ]]>; Fri, 30 Jun 2023 16:11:03 +0000</span> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 lolinder https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 I block ads because they&#39;re psychological warfare that corporations wage against me. I don&#39;t care how unobtrusive the ads are. I don&#39;t care if the ads don&#39;t track me.

I have zero tolerance for ads of any sort. Advertisers have no morals, they&#39;re completely depraved. They&#39;ll eagerly exploit a teenager&#39;s self-conscious body issues to sell useless beauty products.

It&#39;s because they&#39;ve become increasingly obnoxious. Nobody blocked ads when they were a simple column of links in the gutter or maybe an animated GIF banner with 3 frames. No, adblockers became popular because ads kept getting more loud (both visually and audibly), in your face, and resource hungry (remember those flash ads that&#39;d keep your CPU pegged?).

Some of those descendants are very successful now and some descendants of slave owners are probably very poor now. And some people are descendants of both. And then I learn about the Jim Crow period, and then you hear that even the GI bill explicitly excluded black people, and lynchings into the 1950s, and the extremely hard fight the civil rights movement had, and even legal discrimination up to 1971, not to mention tons of possibly illegal but still very real discrimination after that. And then I think: you can&#39;t just stop doing a bad thing and pretend it didn&#39;t happen. You&#39;ve got to try to make things right. Have things been made right by now? I have no idea. I do know plenty of black people still live in fear of the police, and that when black people call the police, there&#39;s the non-zero chance that they&#39;re the ones who end up getting shot. Not to mention that many universities also have affirmative action for children of alumni, who are still predominantly white and rich, partially because of the legal discrimination uo to 1971, and partially because universities are ridiculously expensive. Has that affirmative action also been struck down? >; America is not in the least social-democratic, It used to be, though.

Right? I mean, I can get behind that. But then why the entire detour with race? Up until about 1971 (possibly later, but that&#39;s the date of <i>Loving vs Virginia</i> ), the US had formal, legal discrimination against black people. On finally removing that, there was at various times discussion of whether people who had been legally discriminated against all their lives should be compensated, as if they had been wronged in a tort sense. This would obviously be extremely expensive, and anyway impossible to quantify, so it never happened. Harvard, and many other colleges, has a big base of &quot;legacy&quot; admissions, as well as a certain amount of generational knowledge and connections - you&#39;re more likely to get into Harvard if your parents went to Harvard, over and above mere class status. Since black people were under-represented in this category, people came up with the idea of putting a thumb on the other side of the scale and artificially increasing their rate of admission. Can it balance exactly against the disadvantages of discrimination? No. >; I genuinely don&#39;t get why the race thing is part of the equation. Shouldn&#39;t this just be run-of-the-mill social democratic &quot;lets hand out some extra opportunities/benefits to the poor&quot; program? America is not in the least social-democratic, but racism and anti-racism have been there since the beginning and will probably dominate US politics until the last person who remembers the KKK is dead.

Affirmative Action probably helped my father, whose father was a construction worker and mother a homemaker both of whom dropped out of high school, get into college and ultimately become a doctor.

But it also feels totally irrelevant to me, personally, because of my upper class upbringing and elite education, and I feel like I&#39;ve never really been discriminated against. Though I possibly have been discriminated &quot;for&quot;, and benefited tremendously from it. So I don&#39;t know how I feel about this change. It&#39;s certainly a big one, but in the long run, maybe it&#39;s good?

And advertisement is the rich asking for more money. A man would be annoyed if he found himself in a mob of millionaires, all holding out their silk hats for a penny; or all shouting with one voice, “Give me money.” Yet advertisement does really assault the eye very much as such a shout would assault the ear. “Budge&#39;s Boots are the Best” simply means “Give me money”; “Use Seraphic Soap” simply means “Give me money.” It is a complete mistake to suppose that common people make our towns commonplace, with unsightly things like advertisements. Most of those whose wares are thus placarded everywhere are very wealthy gentlemen with coronets and country seats, men who are probably very particular about the artistic adornment of their own homes.

It&#39;s because they&#39;ve become increasingly obnoxious. Nobody blocked ads when they were a simple column of links in the gutter or maybe an animated GIF banner with 3 frames. No, adblockers became popular because ads kept getting more loud (both visually and audibly), in your face, and resource hungry (remember those flash ads that&#39;d keep your CPU pegged?).

Some of those descendants are very successful now and some descendants of slave owners are probably very poor now. And some people are descendants of both. And then I learn about the Jim Crow period, and then you hear that even the GI bill explicitly excluded black people, and lynchings into the 1950s, and the extremely hard fight the civil rights movement had, and even legal discrimination up to 1971, not to mention tons of possibly illegal but still very real discrimination after that. And then I think: you can&#39;t just stop doing a bad thing and pretend it didn&#39;t happen. You&#39;ve got to try to make things right. Have things been made right by now? I have no idea. I do know plenty of black people still live in fear of the police, and that when black people call the police, there&#39;s the non-zero chance that they&#39;re the ones who end up getting shot. Not to mention that many universities also have affirmative action for children of alumni, who are still predominantly white and rich, partially because of the legal discrimination uo to 1971, and partially because universities are ridiculously expensive. Has that affirmative action also been struck down? >; America is not in the least social-democratic, It used to be, though.

Right? I mean, I can get behind that. But then why the entire detour with race? Up until about 1971 (possibly later, but that&#39;s the date of <i>Loving vs Virginia</i> ), the US had formal, legal discrimination against black people. On finally removing that, there was at various times discussion of whether people who had been legally discriminated against all their lives should be compensated, as if they had been wronged in a tort sense. This would obviously be extremely expensive, and anyway impossible to quantify, so it never happened. Harvard, and many other colleges, has a big base of &quot;legacy&quot; admissions, as well as a certain amount of generational knowledge and connections - you&#39;re more likely to get into Harvard if your parents went to Harvard, over and above mere class status. Since black people were under-represented in this category, people came up with the idea of putting a thumb on the other side of the scale and artificially increasing their rate of admission. Can it balance exactly against the disadvantages of discrimination? No. >; I genuinely don&#39;t get why the race thing is part of the equation. Shouldn&#39;t this just be run-of-the-mill social democratic &quot;lets hand out some extra opportunities/benefits to the poor&quot; program? America is not in the least social-democratic, but racism and anti-racism have been there since the beginning and will probably dominate US politics until the last person who remembers the KKK is dead.

But it also feels totally irrelevant to me, personally, because of my upper class upbringing and elite education, and I feel like I&#39;ve never really been discriminated against. Though I possibly have been discriminated &quot;for&quot;, and benefited tremendously from it. So I don&#39;t know how I feel about this change. It&#39;s certainly a big one, but in the long run, maybe it&#39;s good?

And advertisement is the rich asking for more money. A man would be annoyed if he found himself in a mob of millionaires, all holding out their silk hats for a penny; or all shouting with one voice, “Give me money.” Yet advertisement does really assault the eye very much as such a shout would assault the ear. “Budge&#39;s Boots are the Best” simply means “Give me money”; “Use Seraphic Soap” simply means “Give me money.” It is a complete mistake to suppose that common people make our towns commonplace, with unsightly things like advertisements. Most of those whose wares are thus placarded everywhere are very wealthy gentlemen with coronets and country seats, men who are probably very particular about the artistic adornment of their own homes.

It&#39;s because they&#39;ve become increasingly obnoxious. Nobody blocked ads when they were a simple column of links in the gutter or maybe an animated GIF banner with 3 frames. No, adblockers became popular because ads kept getting more loud (both visually and audibly), in your face, and resource hungry (remember those flash ads that&#39;d keep your CPU pegged?).

Some of those descendants are very successful now and some descendants of slave owners are probably very poor now. And some people are descendants of both. And then I learn about the Jim Crow period, and then you hear that even the GI bill explicitly excluded black people, and lynchings into the 1950s, and the extremely hard fight the civil rights movement had, and even legal discrimination up to 1971, not to mention tons of possibly illegal but still very real discrimination after that. And then I think: you can&#39;t just stop doing a bad thing and pretend it didn&#39;t happen. You&#39;ve got to try to make things right. Have things been made right by now? I have no idea. I do know plenty of black people still live in fear of the police, and that when black people call the police, there&#39;s the non-zero chance that they&#39;re the ones who end up getting shot. Not to mention that many universities also have affirmative action for children of alumni, who are still predominantly white and rich, partially because of the legal discrimination uo to 1971, and partially because universities are ridiculously expensive. Has that affirmative action also been struck down? >; America is not in the least social-democratic, It used to be, though.

Right? I mean, I can get behind that. But then why the entire detour with race? Up until about 1971 (possibly later, but that&#39;s the date of <i>Loving vs Virginia</i> ), the US had formal, legal discrimination against black people. On finally removing that, there was at various times discussion of whether people who had been legally discriminated against all their lives should be compensated, as if they had been wronged in a tort sense. This would obviously be extremely expensive, and anyway impossible to quantify, so it never happened. Harvard, and many other colleges, has a big base of &quot;legacy&quot; admissions, as well as a certain amount of generational knowledge and connections - you&#39;re more likely to get into Harvard if your parents went to Harvard, over and above mere class status. Since black people were under-represented in this category, people came up with the idea of putting a thumb on the other side of the scale and artificially increasing their rate of admission. Can it balance exactly against the disadvantages of discrimination? No. >; I genuinely don&#39;t get why the race thing is part of the equation. Shouldn&#39;t this just be run-of-the-mill social democratic &quot;lets hand out some extra opportunities/benefits to the poor&quot; program? America is not in the least social-democratic, but racism and anti-racism have been there since the beginning and will probably dominate US politics until the last person who remembers the KKK is dead.

Affirmative Action probably helped my father, whose father was a construction worker and mother a homemaker both of whom dropped out of high school, get into college and ultimately become a doctor. But because my father was a doctor, I had a fairly privileged upbringing. I&#39;m a generation removed, but growing up in California always had to indicate my background on standardized tests and always checked &quot;White&quot; for race and then &quot;Hispanic&quot; for ethnicity (which is how all the tests asked it in those days, not sure if it&#39;s still the case), without thinking much about it. I went to MIT, and to this day I wonder how much checking &quot;Hispanic&quot; helped me there and if I &quot;deserved&quot; to go. I was valedictorian and had a perfect score on the SATs and I feel like I was a strong candidate, but then everyone who gets into MIT is strong. And since I did successfully graduate then I guess it was fine that I was accepted, but I was constantly blown away and overwhelmed by the accomplishments of my peers there, and always wondered a bit if I belonged. I&#39;ve always had an identity crisis about what I am. I know in the current zeitgeist there&#39;s a big push for racial justice, of which being Hispanic and &quot;brown&quot; is a part. But it also feels totally irrelevant to me, personally, because of my upper class upbringing and elite education, and I feel like I&#39;ve never really been discriminated against. Though I possibly have been discriminated &quot;for&quot;, and benefited tremendously from it. So I don&#39;t know how I feel about this change. It&#39;s certainly a big one, but in the long run, maybe it&#39;s good? I know I&#39;ve always wondered if being Hispanic helped me get into college or into jobs, but the flip side is that other people must wonder the same... ]]>; Thu, 29 Jun 2023 14:40:31 +0000</span> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36520992 losvedir https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36520992 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36520992 I don&#39;t buy this.

And advertisement is the rich asking for more money. A man would be annoyed if he found himself in a mob of millionaires, all holding out their silk hats for a penny; or all shouting with one voice, “Give me money.” Yet advertisement does really assault the eye very much as such a shout would assault the ear. “Budge&#39;s Boots are the Best” simply means “Give me money”; “Use Seraphic Soap” simply means “Give me money.” It is a complete mistake to suppose that common people make our towns commonplace, with unsightly things like advertisements. Most of those whose wares are thus placarded everywhere are very wealthy gentlemen with coronets and country seats, men who are probably very particular about the artistic adornment of their own homes. They disfigure their towns in order to decorate their houses. — GK Chesterton, <i>The New Jersusalem</i> <a href="http://www.gkc.org.uk/gkc/books/GKC_New_Jerusalem.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.gkc.org.uk/gkc/books/GKC_New_Jerusalem.html</a> ]]>; Fri, 30 Jun 2023 16:11:03 +0000</span> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 lolinder https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 I block ads because they&#39;re psychological warfare that corporations wage against me. I don&#39;t care how unobtrusive the ads are. I don&#39;t care if the ads don&#39;t track me. I grew up changing the channel on TV when ads came on, and ripping adverts out of magazines before sitting down to read them. I vote for billboard bans whenever I can. I have zero tolerance for ads of any sort. Advertisers have no morals, they&#39;re completely depraved. They&#39;ll eagerly exploit a teenager&#39;s self-conscious body issues to sell useless beauty products. They sell sugar water to fat people and at every turn promote the rampant consumerist culture that is destroying our planet.

It&#39;s because they&#39;ve become increasingly obnoxious. Nobody blocked ads when they were a simple column of links in the gutter or maybe an animated GIF banner with 3 frames. No, adblockers became popular because ads kept getting more loud (both visually and audibly), in your face, and resource hungry (remember those flash ads that&#39;d keep your CPU pegged?).

Some of those descendants are very successful now and some descendants of slave owners are probably very poor now. And some people are descendants of both. And then I learn about the Jim Crow period, and then you hear that even the GI bill explicitly excluded black people, and lynchings into the 1950s, and the extremely hard fight the civil rights movement had, and even legal discrimination up to 1971, not to mention tons of possibly illegal but still very real discrimination after that. And then I think: you can&#39;t just stop doing a bad thing and pretend it didn&#39;t happen. You&#39;ve got to try to make things right. Have things been made right by now? I have no idea. I do know plenty of black people still live in fear of the police, and that when black people call the police, there&#39;s the non-zero chance that they&#39;re the ones who end up getting shot. Not to mention that many universities also have affirmative action for children of alumni, who are still predominantly white and rich, partially because of the legal discrimination uo to 1971, and partially because universities are ridiculously expensive. Has that affirmative action also been struck down? >; America is not in the least social-democratic, It used to be, though.

Right? I mean, I can get behind that. But then why the entire detour with race? Up until about 1971 (possibly later, but that&#39;s the date of <i>Loving vs Virginia</i> ), the US had formal, legal discrimination against black people. On finally removing that, there was at various times discussion of whether people who had been legally discriminated against all their lives should be compensated, as if they had been wronged in a tort sense. This would obviously be extremely expensive, and anyway impossible to quantify, so it never happened. Harvard, and many other colleges, has a big base of &quot;legacy&quot; admissions, as well as a certain amount of generational knowledge and connections - you&#39;re more likely to get into Harvard if your parents went to Harvard, over and above mere class status. Since black people were under-represented in this category, people came up with the idea of putting a thumb on the other side of the scale and artificially increasing their rate of admission. Can it balance exactly against the disadvantages of discrimination? No. >; I genuinely don&#39;t get why the race thing is part of the equation. Shouldn&#39;t this just be run-of-the-mill social democratic &quot;lets hand out some extra opportunities/benefits to the poor&quot; program?

Affirmative Action probably helped my father, whose father was a construction worker and mother a homemaker both of whom dropped out of high school, get into college and ultimately become a doctor.

But it also feels totally irrelevant to me, personally, because of my upper class upbringing and elite education, and I feel like I&#39;ve never really been discriminated against. Though I possibly have been discriminated &quot;for&quot;, and benefited tremendously from it. So I don&#39;t know how I feel about this change. It&#39;s certainly a big one, but in the long run, maybe it&#39;s good?

And advertisement is the rich asking for more money. A man would be annoyed if he found himself in a mob of millionaires, all holding out their silk hats for a penny; or all shouting with one voice, “Give me money.” Yet advertisement does really assault the eye very much as such a shout would assault the ear. “Budge&#39;s Boots are the Best” simply means “Give me money”; “Use Seraphic Soap” simply means “Give me money.” It is a complete mistake to suppose that common people make our towns commonplace, with unsightly things like advertisements. Most of those whose wares are thus placarded everywhere are very wealthy gentlemen with coronets and country seats, men who are probably very particular about the artistic adornment of their own homes.

It&#39;s because they&#39;ve become increasingly obnoxious. Nobody blocked ads when they were a simple column of links in the gutter or maybe an animated GIF banner with 3 frames. No, adblockers became popular because ads kept getting more loud (both visually and audibly), in your face, and resource hungry (remember those flash ads that&#39;d keep your CPU pegged?).

Some of those descendants are very successful now and some descendants of slave owners are probably very poor now. And some people are descendants of both. And then I learn about the Jim Crow period, and then you hear that even the GI bill explicitly excluded black people, and lynchings into the 1950s, and the extremely hard fight the civil rights movement had, and even legal discrimination up to 1971, not to mention tons of possibly illegal but still very real discrimination after that. And then I think: you can&#39;t just stop doing a bad thing and pretend it didn&#39;t happen. You&#39;ve got to try to make things right. Have things been made right by now? I have no idea. I do know plenty of black people still live in fear of the police, and that when black people call the police, there&#39;s the non-zero chance that they&#39;re the ones who end up getting shot. Not to mention that many universities also have affirmative action for children of alumni, who are still predominantly white and rich, partially because of the legal discrimination uo to 1971, and partially because universities are ridiculously expensive. Has that affirmative action also been struck down? >; America is not in the least social-democratic, It used to be, though.

Right? I mean, I can get behind that. But then why the entire detour with race? Up until about 1971 (possibly later, but that&#39;s the date of <i>Loving vs Virginia</i> ), the US had formal, legal discrimination against black people. On finally removing that, there was at various times discussion of whether people who had been legally discriminated against all their lives should be compensated, as if they had been wronged in a tort sense. This would obviously be extremely expensive, and anyway impossible to quantify, so it never happened. Harvard, and many other colleges, has a big base of &quot;legacy&quot; admissions, as well as a certain amount of generational knowledge and connections - you&#39;re more likely to get into Harvard if your parents went to Harvard, over and above mere class status. Since black people were under-represented in this category, people came up with the idea of putting a thumb on the other side of the scale and artificially increasing their rate of admission. Can it balance exactly against the disadvantages of discrimination? No. >; I genuinely don&#39;t get why the race thing is part of the equation. Shouldn&#39;t this just be run-of-the-mill social democratic &quot;lets hand out some extra opportunities/benefits to the poor&quot; program?

Affirmative Action probably helped my father, whose father was a construction worker and mother a homemaker both of whom dropped out of high school, get into college and ultimately become a doctor. But because my father was a doctor, I had a fairly privileged upbringing. I&#39;m a generation removed, but growing up in California always had to indicate my background on standardized tests and always checked &quot;White&quot; for race and then &quot;Hispanic&quot; for ethnicity (which is how all the tests asked it in those days, not sure if it&#39;s still the case), without thinking much about it.

But it also feels totally irrelevant to me, personally, because of my upper class upbringing and elite education, and I feel like I&#39;ve never really been discriminated against. Though I possibly have been discriminated &quot;for&quot;, and benefited tremendously from it. So I don&#39;t know how I feel about this change. It&#39;s certainly a big one, but in the long run, maybe it&#39;s good?

And advertisement is the rich asking for more money. A man would be annoyed if he found himself in a mob of millionaires, all holding out their silk hats for a penny; or all shouting with one voice, “Give me money.” Yet advertisement does really assault the eye very much as such a shout would assault the ear. “Budge&#39;s Boots are the Best” simply means “Give me money”; “Use Seraphic Soap” simply means “Give me money.” It is a complete mistake to suppose that common people make our towns commonplace, with unsightly things like advertisements. Most of those whose wares are thus placarded everywhere are very wealthy gentlemen with coronets and country seats, men who are probably very particular about the artistic adornment of their own homes. They disfigure their towns in order to decorate their houses. — GK Chesterton, <i>The New Jersusalem</i> <a href="http://www.gkc.org.uk/gkc/books/GKC_New_Jerusalem.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.gkc.org.uk/gkc/books/GKC_New_Jerusalem.html</a> ]]>; Fri, 30 Jun 2023 16:11:03 +0000</span> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 lolinder https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 I block ads because they&#39;re psychological warfare that corporations wage against me. I don&#39;t care how unobtrusive the ads are. I don&#39;t care if the ads don&#39;t track me.

I have zero tolerance for ads of any sort. Advertisers have no morals, they&#39;re completely depraved. They&#39;ll eagerly exploit a teenager&#39;s self-conscious body issues to sell useless beauty products.

It&#39;s because they&#39;ve become increasingly obnoxious. Nobody blocked ads when they were a simple column of links in the gutter or maybe an animated GIF banner with 3 frames. No, adblockers became popular because ads kept getting more loud (both visually and audibly), in your face, and resource hungry (remember those flash ads that&#39;d keep your CPU pegged?).

Some of those descendants are very successful now and some descendants of slave owners are probably very poor now. And some people are descendants of both. And then I learn about the Jim Crow period, and then you hear that even the GI bill explicitly excluded black people, and lynchings into the 1950s, and the extremely hard fight the civil rights movement had, and even legal discrimination up to 1971, not to mention tons of possibly illegal but still very real discrimination after that. And then I think: you can&#39;t just stop doing a bad thing and pretend it didn&#39;t happen. You&#39;ve got to try to make things right. Have things been made right by now? I have no idea. I do know plenty of black people still live in fear of the police, and that when black people call the police, there&#39;s the non-zero chance that they&#39;re the ones who end up getting shot. Not to mention that many universities also have affirmative action for children of alumni, who are still predominantly white and rich, partially because of the legal discrimination uo to 1971, and partially because universities are ridiculously expensive. Has that affirmative action also been struck down? >; America is not in the least social-democratic, It used to be, though.

Right? I mean, I can get behind that. But then why the entire detour with race? Up until about 1971 (possibly later, but that&#39;s the date of <i>Loving vs Virginia</i> ), the US had formal, legal discrimination against black people. On finally removing that, there was at various times discussion of whether people who had been legally discriminated against all their lives should be compensated, as if they had been wronged in a tort sense. This would obviously be extremely expensive, and anyway impossible to quantify, so it never happened. Harvard, and many other colleges, has a big base of &quot;legacy&quot; admissions, as well as a certain amount of generational knowledge and connections - you&#39;re more likely to get into Harvard if your parents went to Harvard, over and above mere class status. Since black people were under-represented in this category, people came up with the idea of putting a thumb on the other side of the scale and artificially increasing their rate of admission. Can it balance exactly against the disadvantages of discrimination? No. >; I genuinely don&#39;t get why the race thing is part of the equation. Shouldn&#39;t this just be run-of-the-mill social democratic &quot;lets hand out some extra opportunities/benefits to the poor&quot; program? America is not in the least social-democratic, but racism and anti-racism have been there since the beginning and will probably dominate US politics until the last person who remembers the KKK is dead.

Affirmative Action probably helped my father, whose father was a construction worker and mother a homemaker both of whom dropped out of high school, get into college and ultimately become a doctor. But because my father was a doctor, I had a fairly privileged upbringing. I&#39;m a generation removed, but growing up in California always had to indicate my background on standardized tests and always checked &quot;White&quot; for race and then &quot;Hispanic&quot; for ethnicity (which is how all the tests asked it in those days, not sure if it&#39;s still the case), without thinking much about it.

But it also feels totally irrelevant to me, personally, because of my upper class upbringing and elite education, and I feel like I&#39;ve never really been discriminated against. Though I possibly have been discriminated &quot;for&quot;, and benefited tremendously from it. So I don&#39;t know how I feel about this change. It&#39;s certainly a big one, but in the long run, maybe it&#39;s good?

And advertisement is the rich asking for more money. A man would be annoyed if he found himself in a mob of millionaires, all holding out their silk hats for a penny; or all shouting with one voice, “Give me money.” Yet advertisement does really assault the eye very much as such a shout would assault the ear. “Budge&#39;s Boots are the Best” simply means “Give me money”; “Use Seraphic Soap” simply means “Give me money.” It is a complete mistake to suppose that common people make our towns commonplace, with unsightly things like advertisements. Most of those whose wares are thus placarded everywhere are very wealthy gentlemen with coronets and country seats, men who are probably very particular about the artistic adornment of their own homes. They disfigure their towns in order to decorate their houses. — GK Chesterton, <i>The New Jersusalem</i> <a href="http://www.gkc.org.uk/gkc/books/GKC_New_Jerusalem.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.gkc.org.uk/gkc/books/GKC_New_Jerusalem.html</a> ]]>; Fri, 30 Jun 2023 16:11:03 +0000</span> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 lolinder https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 I block ads because they&#39;re psychological warfare that corporations wage against me. I don&#39;t care how unobtrusive the ads are. I don&#39;t care if the ads don&#39;t track me.

I have zero tolerance for ads of any sort. Advertisers have no morals, they&#39;re completely depraved. They&#39;ll eagerly exploit a teenager&#39;s self-conscious body issues to sell useless beauty products.

It&#39;s because they&#39;ve become increasingly obnoxious. Nobody blocked ads when they were a simple column of links in the gutter or maybe an animated GIF banner with 3 frames. No, adblockers became popular because ads kept getting more loud (both visually and audibly), in your face, and resource hungry (remember those flash ads that&#39;d keep your CPU pegged?).

Some of those descendants are very successful now and some descendants of slave owners are probably very poor now. And some people are descendants of both. And then I learn about the Jim Crow period, and then you hear that even the GI bill explicitly excluded black people, and lynchings into the 1950s, and the extremely hard fight the civil rights movement had, and even legal discrimination up to 1971, not to mention tons of possibly illegal but still very real discrimination after that. And then I think: you can&#39;t just stop doing a bad thing and pretend it didn&#39;t happen. You&#39;ve got to try to make things right. Have things been made right by now? I have no idea. I do know plenty of black people still live in fear of the police, and that when black people call the police, there&#39;s the non-zero chance that they&#39;re the ones who end up getting shot. Not to mention that many universities also have affirmative action for children of alumni, who are still predominantly white and rich, partially because of the legal discrimination uo to 1971, and partially because universities are ridiculously expensive. Has that affirmative action also been struck down? >; America is not in the least social-democratic, It used to be, though.

Right? I mean, I can get behind that. But then why the entire detour with race? Up until about 1971 (possibly later, but that&#39;s the date of <i>Loving vs Virginia</i> ), the US had formal, legal discrimination against black people. On finally removing that, there was at various times discussion of whether people who had been legally discriminated against all their lives should be compensated, as if they had been wronged in a tort sense. This would obviously be extremely expensive, and anyway impossible to quantify, so it never happened. Harvard, and many other colleges, has a big base of &quot;legacy&quot; admissions, as well as a certain amount of generational knowledge and connections - you&#39;re more likely to get into Harvard if your parents went to Harvard, over and above mere class status. Since black people were under-represented in this category, people came up with the idea of putting a thumb on the other side of the scale and artificially increasing their rate of admission. Can it balance exactly against the disadvantages of discrimination? No. >; I genuinely don&#39;t get why the race thing is part of the equation. Shouldn&#39;t this just be run-of-the-mill social democratic &quot;lets hand out some extra opportunities/benefits to the poor&quot; program? America is not in the least social-democratic, but racism and anti-racism have been there since the beginning and will probably dominate US politics until the last person who remembers the KKK is dead.

Affirmative Action probably helped my father, whose father was a construction worker and mother a homemaker both of whom dropped out of high school, get into college and ultimately become a doctor.

But it also feels totally irrelevant to me, personally, because of my upper class upbringing and elite education, and I feel like I&#39;ve never really been discriminated against. Though I possibly have been discriminated &quot;for&quot;, and benefited tremendously from it. So I don&#39;t know how I feel about this change. It&#39;s certainly a big one, but in the long run, maybe it&#39;s good?

And advertisement is the rich asking for more money. A man would be annoyed if he found himself in a mob of millionaires, all holding out their silk hats for a penny; or all shouting with one voice, “Give me money.” Yet advertisement does really assault the eye very much as such a shout would assault the ear. “Budge&#39;s Boots are the Best” simply means “Give me money”; “Use Seraphic Soap” simply means “Give me money.” It is a complete mistake to suppose that common people make our towns commonplace, with unsightly things like advertisements. Most of those whose wares are thus placarded everywhere are very wealthy gentlemen with coronets and country seats, men who are probably very particular about the artistic adornment of their own homes.

It&#39;s because they&#39;ve become increasingly obnoxious. Nobody blocked ads when they were a simple column of links in the gutter or maybe an animated GIF banner with 3 frames. No, adblockers became popular because ads kept getting more loud (both visually and audibly), in your face, and resource hungry (remember those flash ads that&#39;d keep your CPU pegged?).

Some of those descendants are very successful now and some descendants of slave owners are probably very poor now. And some people are descendants of both. And then I learn about the Jim Crow period, and then you hear that even the GI bill explicitly excluded black people, and lynchings into the 1950s, and the extremely hard fight the civil rights movement had, and even legal discrimination up to 1971, not to mention tons of possibly illegal but still very real discrimination after that. And then I think: you can&#39;t just stop doing a bad thing and pretend it didn&#39;t happen. You&#39;ve got to try to make things right. Have things been made right by now? I have no idea. I do know plenty of black people still live in fear of the police, and that when black people call the police, there&#39;s the non-zero chance that they&#39;re the ones who end up getting shot. Not to mention that many universities also have affirmative action for children of alumni, who are still predominantly white and rich, partially because of the legal discrimination uo to 1971, and partially because universities are ridiculously expensive. Has that affirmative action also been struck down? >; America is not in the least social-democratic, It used to be, though.

Right? I mean, I can get behind that. But then why the entire detour with race? Up until about 1971 (possibly later, but that&#39;s the date of <i>Loving vs Virginia</i> ), the US had formal, legal discrimination against black people. On finally removing that, there was at various times discussion of whether people who had been legally discriminated against all their lives should be compensated, as if they had been wronged in a tort sense. This would obviously be extremely expensive, and anyway impossible to quantify, so it never happened. Harvard, and many other colleges, has a big base of &quot;legacy&quot; admissions, as well as a certain amount of generational knowledge and connections - you&#39;re more likely to get into Harvard if your parents went to Harvard, over and above mere class status. Since black people were under-represented in this category, people came up with the idea of putting a thumb on the other side of the scale and artificially increasing their rate of admission. Can it balance exactly against the disadvantages of discrimination? No. >; I genuinely don&#39;t get why the race thing is part of the equation. Shouldn&#39;t this just be run-of-the-mill social democratic &quot;lets hand out some extra opportunities/benefits to the poor&quot; program? America is not in the least social-democratic, but racism and anti-racism have been there since the beginning and will probably dominate US politics until the last person who remembers the KKK is dead.

Affirmative Action probably helped my father, whose father was a construction worker and mother a homemaker both of whom dropped out of high school, get into college and ultimately become a doctor.

But it also feels totally irrelevant to me, personally, because of my upper class upbringing and elite education, and I feel like I&#39;ve never really been discriminated against. Though I possibly have been discriminated &quot;for&quot;, and benefited tremendously from it. So I don&#39;t know how I feel about this change. It&#39;s certainly a big one, but in the long run, maybe it&#39;s good?

And advertisement is the rich asking for more money. A man would be annoyed if he found himself in a mob of millionaires, all holding out their silk hats for a penny; or all shouting with one voice, “Give me money.” Yet advertisement does really assault the eye very much as such a shout would assault the ear. “Budge&#39;s Boots are the Best” simply means “Give me money”; “Use Seraphic Soap” simply means “Give me money.” It is a complete mistake to suppose that common people make our towns commonplace, with unsightly things like advertisements. Most of those whose wares are thus placarded everywhere are very wealthy gentlemen with coronets and country seats, men who are probably very particular about the artistic adornment of their own homes.

It&#39;s because they&#39;ve become increasingly obnoxious. Nobody blocked ads when they were a simple column of links in the gutter or maybe an animated GIF banner with 3 frames. No, adblockers became popular because ads kept getting more loud (both visually and audibly), in your face, and resource hungry (remember those flash ads that&#39;d keep your CPU pegged?).

Some of those descendants are very successful now and some descendants of slave owners are probably very poor now. And some people are descendants of both. And then I learn about the Jim Crow period, and then you hear that even the GI bill explicitly excluded black people, and lynchings into the 1950s, and the extremely hard fight the civil rights movement had, and even legal discrimination up to 1971, not to mention tons of possibly illegal but still very real discrimination after that. And then I think: you can&#39;t just stop doing a bad thing and pretend it didn&#39;t happen. You&#39;ve got to try to make things right. Have things been made right by now? I have no idea. I do know plenty of black people still live in fear of the police, and that when black people call the police, there&#39;s the non-zero chance that they&#39;re the ones who end up getting shot. Not to mention that many universities also have affirmative action for children of alumni, who are still predominantly white and rich, partially because of the legal discrimination uo to 1971, and partially because universities are ridiculously expensive. Has that affirmative action also been struck down? >; America is not in the least social-democratic, It used to be, though.

Right? I mean, I can get behind that. But then why the entire detour with race? Up until about 1971 (possibly later, but that&#39;s the date of <i>Loving vs Virginia</i> ), the US had formal, legal discrimination against black people. On finally removing that, there was at various times discussion of whether people who had been legally discriminated against all their lives should be compensated, as if they had been wronged in a tort sense. This would obviously be extremely expensive, and anyway impossible to quantify, so it never happened. Harvard, and many other colleges, has a big base of &quot;legacy&quot; admissions, as well as a certain amount of generational knowledge and connections - you&#39;re more likely to get into Harvard if your parents went to Harvard, over and above mere class status. Since black people were under-represented in this category, people came up with the idea of putting a thumb on the other side of the scale and artificially increasing their rate of admission. Can it balance exactly against the disadvantages of discrimination? No. >; I genuinely don&#39;t get why the race thing is part of the equation. Shouldn&#39;t this just be run-of-the-mill social democratic &quot;lets hand out some extra opportunities/benefits to the poor&quot; program? America is not in the least social-democratic, but racism and anti-racism have been there since the beginning and will probably dominate US politics until the last person who remembers the KKK is dead.

Affirmative Action probably helped my father, whose father was a construction worker and mother a homemaker both of whom dropped out of high school, get into college and ultimately become a doctor. But because my father was a doctor, I had a fairly privileged upbringing. I&#39;m a generation removed, but growing up in California always had to indicate my background on standardized tests and always checked &quot;White&quot; for race and then &quot;Hispanic&quot; for ethnicity (which is how all the tests asked it in those days, not sure if it&#39;s still the case), without thinking much about it.

But it also feels totally irrelevant to me, personally, because of my upper class upbringing and elite education, and I feel like I&#39;ve never really been discriminated against. Though I possibly have been discriminated &quot;for&quot;, and benefited tremendously from it. So I don&#39;t know how I feel about this change. It&#39;s certainly a big one, but in the long run, maybe it&#39;s good?

And advertisement is the rich asking for more money. A man would be annoyed if he found himself in a mob of millionaires, all holding out their silk hats for a penny; or all shouting with one voice, “Give me money.” Yet advertisement does really assault the eye very much as such a shout would assault the ear. “Budge&#39;s Boots are the Best” simply means “Give me money”; “Use Seraphic Soap” simply means “Give me money.” It is a complete mistake to suppose that common people make our towns commonplace, with unsightly things like advertisements. Most of those whose wares are thus placarded everywhere are very wealthy gentlemen with coronets and country seats, men who are probably very particular about the artistic adornment of their own homes.

It&#39;s because they&#39;ve become increasingly obnoxious. Nobody blocked ads when they were a simple column of links in the gutter or maybe an animated GIF banner with 3 frames. No, adblockers became popular because ads kept getting more loud (both visually and audibly), in your face, and resource hungry (remember those flash ads that&#39;d keep your CPU pegged?).

Some of those descendants are very successful now and some descendants of slave owners are probably very poor now. And some people are descendants of both. And then I learn about the Jim Crow period, and then you hear that even the GI bill explicitly excluded black people, and lynchings into the 1950s, and the extremely hard fight the civil rights movement had, and even legal discrimination up to 1971, not to mention tons of possibly illegal but still very real discrimination after that. And then I think: you can&#39;t just stop doing a bad thing and pretend it didn&#39;t happen. You&#39;ve got to try to make things right. Have things been made right by now? I have no idea. I do know plenty of black people still live in fear of the police, and that when black people call the police, there&#39;s the non-zero chance that they&#39;re the ones who end up getting shot. Not to mention that many universities also have affirmative action for children of alumni, who are still predominantly white and rich, partially because of the legal discrimination uo to 1971, and partially because universities are ridiculously expensive. Has that affirmative action also been struck down? >; America is not in the least social-democratic, It used to be, though.

Right? I mean, I can get behind that. But then why the entire detour with race? Up until about 1971 (possibly later, but that&#39;s the date of <i>Loving vs Virginia</i> ), the US had formal, legal discrimination against black people. On finally removing that, there was at various times discussion of whether people who had been legally discriminated against all their lives should be compensated, as if they had been wronged in a tort sense. This would obviously be extremely expensive, and anyway impossible to quantify, so it never happened. Harvard, and many other colleges, has a big base of &quot;legacy&quot; admissions, as well as a certain amount of generational knowledge and connections - you&#39;re more likely to get into Harvard if your parents went to Harvard, over and above mere class status. Since black people were under-represented in this category, people came up with the idea of putting a thumb on the other side of the scale and artificially increasing their rate of admission. Can it balance exactly against the disadvantages of discrimination? No. >; I genuinely don&#39;t get why the race thing is part of the equation. Shouldn&#39;t this just be run-of-the-mill social democratic &quot;lets hand out some extra opportunities/benefits to the poor&quot; program? America is not in the least social-democratic, but racism and anti-racism have been there since the beginning and will probably dominate US politics until the last person who remembers the KKK is dead.

Affirmative Action probably helped my father, whose father was a construction worker and mother a homemaker both of whom dropped out of high school, get into college and ultimately become a doctor. But because my father was a doctor, I had a fairly privileged upbringing.

But it also feels totally irrelevant to me, personally, because of my upper class upbringing and elite education, and I feel like I&#39;ve never really been discriminated against. Though I possibly have been discriminated &quot;for&quot;, and benefited tremendously from it. So I don&#39;t know how I feel about this change. It&#39;s certainly a big one, but in the long run, maybe it&#39;s good?

And advertisement is the rich asking for more money. A man would be annoyed if he found himself in a mob of millionaires, all holding out their silk hats for a penny; or all shouting with one voice, “Give me money.” Yet advertisement does really assault the eye very much as such a shout would assault the ear. “Budge&#39;s Boots are the Best” simply means “Give me money”; “Use Seraphic Soap” simply means “Give me money.” It is a complete mistake to suppose that common people make our towns commonplace, with unsightly things like advertisements. Most of those whose wares are thus placarded everywhere are very wealthy gentlemen with coronets and country seats, men who are probably very particular about the artistic adornment of their own homes.

They&#39;ll eagerly exploit a teenager&#39;s self-conscious body issues to sell useless beauty products.

It&#39;s because they&#39;ve become increasingly obnoxious. Nobody blocked ads when they were a simple column of links in the gutter or maybe an animated GIF banner with 3 frames. No, adblockers became popular because ads kept getting more loud (both visually and audibly), in your face, and resource hungry (remember those flash ads that&#39;d keep your CPU pegged?).

Some of those descendants are very successful now and some descendants of slave owners are probably very poor now. And some people are descendants of both. And then I learn about the Jim Crow period, and then you hear that even the GI bill explicitly excluded black people, and lynchings into the 1950s, and the extremely hard fight the civil rights movement had, and even legal discrimination up to 1971, not to mention tons of possibly illegal but still very real discrimination after that. And then I think: you can&#39;t just stop doing a bad thing and pretend it didn&#39;t happen. You&#39;ve got to try to make things right. Have things been made right by now? I have no idea. I do know plenty of black people still live in fear of the police, and that when black people call the police, there&#39;s the non-zero chance that they&#39;re the ones who end up getting shot. Not to mention that many universities also have affirmative action for children of alumni, who are still predominantly white and rich, partially because of the legal discrimination uo to 1971, and partially because universities are ridiculously expensive. Has that affirmative action also been struck down? >; America is not in the least social-democratic, It used to be, though.

Right? I mean, I can get behind that. But then why the entire detour with race? Up until about 1971 (possibly later, but that&#39;s the date of <i>Loving vs Virginia</i> ), the US had formal, legal discrimination against black people. On finally removing that, there was at various times discussion of whether people who had been legally discriminated against all their lives should be compensated, as if they had been wronged in a tort sense. This would obviously be extremely expensive, and anyway impossible to quantify, so it never happened. Harvard, and many other colleges, has a big base of &quot;legacy&quot; admissions, as well as a certain amount of generational knowledge and connections - you&#39;re more likely to get into Harvard if your parents went to Harvard, over and above mere class status. Since black people were under-represented in this category, people came up with the idea of putting a thumb on the other side of the scale and artificially increasing their rate of admission. Can it balance exactly against the disadvantages of discrimination? No. >; I genuinely don&#39;t get why the race thing is part of the equation. Shouldn&#39;t this just be run-of-the-mill social democratic &quot;lets hand out some extra opportunities/benefits to the poor&quot; program? America is not in the least social-democratic, but racism and anti-racism have been there since the beginning and will probably dominate US politics until the last person who remembers the KKK is dead.

Affirmative Action probably helped my father, whose father was a construction worker and mother a homemaker both of whom dropped out of high school, get into college and ultimately become a doctor. But because my father was a doctor, I had a fairly privileged upbringing. I&#39;m a generation removed, but growing up in California always had to indicate my background on standardized tests and always checked &quot;White&quot; for race and then &quot;Hispanic&quot; for ethnicity (which is how all the tests asked it in those days, not sure if it&#39;s still the case), without thinking much about it.

But it also feels totally irrelevant to me, personally, because of my upper class upbringing and elite education, and I feel like I&#39;ve never really been discriminated against. Though I possibly have been discriminated &quot;for&quot;, and benefited tremendously from it. So I don&#39;t know how I feel about this change. It&#39;s certainly a big one, but in the long run, maybe it&#39;s good?

And advertisement is the rich asking for more money. A man would be annoyed if he found himself in a mob of millionaires, all holding out their silk hats for a penny; or all shouting with one voice, “Give me money.” Yet advertisement does really assault the eye very much as such a shout would assault the ear. “Budge&#39;s Boots are the Best” simply means “Give me money”; “Use Seraphic Soap” simply means “Give me money.” It is a complete mistake to suppose that common people make our towns commonplace, with unsightly things like advertisements. Most of those whose wares are thus placarded everywhere are very wealthy gentlemen with coronets and country seats, men who are probably very particular about the artistic adornment of their own homes. They disfigure their towns in order to decorate their houses. — GK Chesterton, <i>The New Jersusalem</i> <a href="http://www.gkc.org.uk/gkc/books/GKC_New_Jerusalem.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.gkc.org.uk/gkc/books/GKC_New_Jerusalem.html</a> ]]>; Fri, 30 Jun 2023 16:11:03 +0000</span> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 lolinder https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 I block ads because they&#39;re psychological warfare that corporations wage against me. I don&#39;t care how unobtrusive the ads are. I don&#39;t care if the ads don&#39;t track me.

I have zero tolerance for ads of any sort. Advertisers have no morals, they&#39;re completely depraved. They&#39;ll eagerly exploit a teenager&#39;s self-conscious body issues to sell useless beauty products.

It&#39;s because they&#39;ve become increasingly obnoxious. Nobody blocked ads when they were a simple column of links in the gutter or maybe an animated GIF banner with 3 frames. No, adblockers became popular because ads kept getting more loud (both visually and audibly), in your face, and resource hungry (remember those flash ads that&#39;d keep your CPU pegged?).

Some of those descendants are very successful now and some descendants of slave owners are probably very poor now. And some people are descendants of both. And then I learn about the Jim Crow period, and then you hear that even the GI bill explicitly excluded black people, and lynchings into the 1950s, and the extremely hard fight the civil rights movement had, and even legal discrimination up to 1971, not to mention tons of possibly illegal but still very real discrimination after that. And then I think: you can&#39;t just stop doing a bad thing and pretend it didn&#39;t happen. You&#39;ve got to try to make things right. Have things been made right by now? I have no idea. I do know plenty of black people still live in fear of the police, and that when black people call the police, there&#39;s the non-zero chance that they&#39;re the ones who end up getting shot. Not to mention that many universities also have affirmative action for children of alumni, who are still predominantly white and rich, partially because of the legal discrimination uo to 1971, and partially because universities are ridiculously expensive. Has that affirmative action also been struck down? >; America is not in the least social-democratic, It used to be, though. The New Deal and many of the social policies of the 1940s and 1950s were very social democratic. Well, except that they tended to exclude black people. ]]>; Thu, 29 Jun 2023 15:57:26 +0000</span> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36522205 mcv https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36522205 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36522205 >; I assume the intent is to help disadvantaged people have opportunities that more priviledged people have already. Right? I mean, I can get behind that. But then why the entire detour with race? Up until about 1971 (possibly later, but that&#39;s the date of <i>Loving vs Virginia</i> ), the US had formal, legal discrimination against black people. On finally removing that, there was at various times discussion of whether people who had been legally discriminated against all their lives should be compensated, as if they had been wronged in a tort sense. This would obviously be extremely expensive, and anyway impossible to quantify, so it never happened. Harvard, and many other colleges, has a big base of &quot;legacy&quot; admissions, as well as a certain amount of generational knowledge and connections - you&#39;re more likely to get into Harvard if your parents went to Harvard, over and above mere class status. Since black people were under-represented in this category, people came up with the idea of putting a thumb on the other side of the scale and artificially increasing their rate of admission. Can it balance exactly against the disadvantages of discrimination? No. >; I genuinely don&#39;t get why the race thing is part of the equation. Shouldn&#39;t this just be run-of-the-mill social democratic &quot;lets hand out some extra opportunities/benefits to the poor&quot; program? America is not in the least social-democratic, but racism and anti-racism have been there since the beginning and will probably dominate US politics until the last person who remembers the KKK is dead. (It could be worse: Haitians who had freed themselves from slavery by the mass murder of their oppressors were made to pay a huge amount of compensation to them!) ]]>; Thu, 29 Jun 2023 15:47:11 +0000</span> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36522049 pjc50 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36522049 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36522049 The concept of affirmative action is foreign to me (quite literally so). I only know it from American media, and I&#39;ve come understand it to mean &quot;positively discriminate based on race, so long as it&#39;s a minority race&quot; - please correct me of I&#39;m wrong. But anyway, my question for the Americans here who grok this stuff: I assume the intent is to help disadvantaged people have opportunities that more priviledged people have already. Right?

Affirmative Action probably helped my father, whose father was a construction worker and mother a homemaker both of whom dropped out of high school, get into college and ultimately become a doctor. But because my father was a doctor, I had a fairly privileged upbringing. I&#39;m a generation removed, but growing up in California always had to indicate my background on standardized tests and always checked &quot;White&quot; for race and then &quot;Hispanic&quot; for ethnicity (which is how all the tests asked it in those days, not sure if it&#39;s still the case), without thinking much about it.

Affirmative Action probably helped my father, whose father was a construction worker and mother a homemaker both of whom dropped out of high school, get into college and ultimately become a doctor. But because my father was a doctor, I had a fairly privileged upbringing. I&#39;m a generation removed, but growing up in California always had to indicate my background on standardized tests and always checked &quot;White&quot; for race and then &quot;Hispanic&quot; for ethnicity (which is how all the tests asked it in those days, not sure if it&#39;s still the case), without thinking much about it.

But it also feels totally irrelevant to me, personally, because of my upper class upbringing and elite education, and I feel like I&#39;ve never really been discriminated against. Though I possibly have been discriminated &quot;for&quot;, and benefited tremendously from it. So I don&#39;t know how I feel about this change. It&#39;s certainly a big one, but in the long run, maybe it&#39;s good?

And advertisement is the rich asking for more money. A man would be annoyed if he found himself in a mob of millionaires, all holding out their silk hats for a penny; or all shouting with one voice, “Give me money.” Yet advertisement does really assault the eye very much as such a shout would assault the ear. “Budge&#39;s Boots are the Best” simply means “Give me money”; “Use Seraphic Soap” simply means “Give me money.” It is a complete mistake to suppose that common people make our towns commonplace, with unsightly things like advertisements. Most of those whose wares are thus placarded everywhere are very wealthy gentlemen with coronets and country seats, men who are probably very particular about the artistic adornment of their own homes. They disfigure their towns in order to decorate their houses. — GK Chesterton, <i>The New Jersusalem</i> <a href="http://www.gkc.org.uk/gkc/books/GKC_New_Jerusalem.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.gkc.org.uk/gkc/books/GKC_New_Jerusalem.html</a> ]]>; Fri, 30 Jun 2023 16:11:03 +0000</span> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 lolinder https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 I block ads because they&#39;re psychological warfare that corporations wage against me. I don&#39;t care how unobtrusive the ads are. I don&#39;t care if the ads don&#39;t track me.

I have zero tolerance for ads of any sort. Advertisers have no morals, they&#39;re completely depraved. They&#39;ll eagerly exploit a teenager&#39;s self-conscious body issues to sell useless beauty products.

It&#39;s because they&#39;ve become increasingly obnoxious. Nobody blocked ads when they were a simple column of links in the gutter or maybe an animated GIF banner with 3 frames. No, adblockers became popular because ads kept getting more loud (both visually and audibly), in your face, and resource hungry (remember those flash ads that&#39;d keep your CPU pegged?).

Some of those descendants are very successful now and some descendants of slave owners are probably very poor now. And some people are descendants of both. And then I learn about the Jim Crow period, and then you hear that even the GI bill explicitly excluded black people, and lynchings into the 1950s, and the extremely hard fight the civil rights movement had, and even legal discrimination up to 1971, not to mention tons of possibly illegal but still very real discrimination after that. And then I think: you can&#39;t just stop doing a bad thing and pretend it didn&#39;t happen. You&#39;ve got to try to make things right. Have things been made right by now? I have no idea. I do know plenty of black people still live in fear of the police, and that when black people call the police, there&#39;s the non-zero chance that they&#39;re the ones who end up getting shot. Not to mention that many universities also have affirmative action for children of alumni, who are still predominantly white and rich, partially because of the legal discrimination uo to 1971, and partially because universities are ridiculously expensive. Has that affirmative action also been struck down? >; America is not in the least social-democratic, It used to be, though.

Right? I mean, I can get behind that. But then why the entire detour with race? Up until about 1971 (possibly later, but that&#39;s the date of <i>Loving vs Virginia</i> ), the US had formal, legal discrimination against black people. On finally removing that, there was at various times discussion of whether people who had been legally discriminated against all their lives should be compensated, as if they had been wronged in a tort sense. This would obviously be extremely expensive, and anyway impossible to quantify, so it never happened. Harvard, and many other colleges, has a big base of &quot;legacy&quot; admissions, as well as a certain amount of generational knowledge and connections - you&#39;re more likely to get into Harvard if your parents went to Harvard, over and above mere class status. Since black people were under-represented in this category, people came up with the idea of putting a thumb on the other side of the scale and artificially increasing their rate of admission. Can it balance exactly against the disadvantages of discrimination? No. >; I genuinely don&#39;t get why the race thing is part of the equation. Shouldn&#39;t this just be run-of-the-mill social democratic &quot;lets hand out some extra opportunities/benefits to the poor&quot; program? America is not in the least social-democratic, but racism and anti-racism have been there since the beginning and will probably dominate US politics until the last person who remembers the KKK is dead.

Affirmative Action probably helped my father, whose father was a construction worker and mother a homemaker both of whom dropped out of high school, get into college and ultimately become a doctor. But because my father was a doctor, I had a fairly privileged upbringing. I&#39;m a generation removed, but growing up in California always had to indicate my background on standardized tests and always checked &quot;White&quot; for race and then &quot;Hispanic&quot; for ethnicity (which is how all the tests asked it in those days, not sure if it&#39;s still the case), without thinking much about it.

But it also feels totally irrelevant to me, personally, because of my upper class upbringing and elite education, and I feel like I&#39;ve never really been discriminated against. Though I possibly have been discriminated &quot;for&quot;, and benefited tremendously from it. So I don&#39;t know how I feel about this change. It&#39;s certainly a big one, but in the long run, maybe it&#39;s good?

And advertisement is the rich asking for more money. A man would be annoyed if he found himself in a mob of millionaires, all holding out their silk hats for a penny; or all shouting with one voice, “Give me money.” Yet advertisement does really assault the eye very much as such a shout would assault the ear. “Budge&#39;s Boots are the Best” simply means “Give me money”; “Use Seraphic Soap” simply means “Give me money.” It is a complete mistake to suppose that common people make our towns commonplace, with unsightly things like advertisements. Most of those whose wares are thus placarded everywhere are very wealthy gentlemen with coronets and country seats, men who are probably very particular about the artistic adornment of their own homes. They disfigure their towns in order to decorate their houses. — GK Chesterton, <i>The New Jersusalem</i> <a href="http://www.gkc.org.uk/gkc/books/GKC_New_Jerusalem.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.gkc.org.uk/gkc/books/GKC_New_Jerusalem.html</a> ]]>; Fri, 30 Jun 2023 16:11:03 +0000</span> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 lolinder https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 I block ads because they&#39;re psychological warfare that corporations wage against me. I don&#39;t care how unobtrusive the ads are. I don&#39;t care if the ads don&#39;t track me.

I have zero tolerance for ads of any sort. Advertisers have no morals, they&#39;re completely depraved. They&#39;ll eagerly exploit a teenager&#39;s self-conscious body issues to sell useless beauty products.

It&#39;s because they&#39;ve become increasingly obnoxious. Nobody blocked ads when they were a simple column of links in the gutter or maybe an animated GIF banner with 3 frames. No, adblockers became popular because ads kept getting more loud (both visually and audibly), in your face, and resource hungry (remember those flash ads that&#39;d keep your CPU pegged?).

Some of those descendants are very successful now and some descendants of slave owners are probably very poor now. And some people are descendants of both. And then I learn about the Jim Crow period, and then you hear that even the GI bill explicitly excluded black people, and lynchings into the 1950s, and the extremely hard fight the civil rights movement had, and even legal discrimination up to 1971, not to mention tons of possibly illegal but still very real discrimination after that. And then I think: you can&#39;t just stop doing a bad thing and pretend it didn&#39;t happen. You&#39;ve got to try to make things right. Have things been made right by now? I have no idea. I do know plenty of black people still live in fear of the police, and that when black people call the police, there&#39;s the non-zero chance that they&#39;re the ones who end up getting shot. Not to mention that many universities also have affirmative action for children of alumni, who are still predominantly white and rich, partially because of the legal discrimination uo to 1971, and partially because universities are ridiculously expensive. Has that affirmative action also been struck down? >; America is not in the least social-democratic, It used to be, though.

Right? I mean, I can get behind that. But then why the entire detour with race? Up until about 1971 (possibly later, but that&#39;s the date of <i>Loving vs Virginia</i> ), the US had formal, legal discrimination against black people. On finally removing that, there was at various times discussion of whether people who had been legally discriminated against all their lives should be compensated, as if they had been wronged in a tort sense. This would obviously be extremely expensive, and anyway impossible to quantify, so it never happened. Harvard, and many other colleges, has a big base of &quot;legacy&quot; admissions, as well as a certain amount of generational knowledge and connections - you&#39;re more likely to get into Harvard if your parents went to Harvard, over and above mere class status. Since black people were under-represented in this category, people came up with the idea of putting a thumb on the other side of the scale and artificially increasing their rate of admission. Can it balance exactly against the disadvantages of discrimination? No. >; I genuinely don&#39;t get why the race thing is part of the equation. Shouldn&#39;t this just be run-of-the-mill social democratic &quot;lets hand out some extra opportunities/benefits to the poor&quot; program? America is not in the least social-democratic, but racism and anti-racism have been there since the beginning and will probably dominate US politics until the last person who remembers the KKK is dead.

Affirmative Action probably helped my father, whose father was a construction worker and mother a homemaker both of whom dropped out of high school, get into college and ultimately become a doctor.

But it also feels totally irrelevant to me, personally, because of my upper class upbringing and elite education, and I feel like I&#39;ve never really been discriminated against. Though I possibly have been discriminated &quot;for&quot;, and benefited tremendously from it. So I don&#39;t know how I feel about this change. It&#39;s certainly a big one, but in the long run, maybe it&#39;s good?

And advertisement is the rich asking for more money. A man would be annoyed if he found himself in a mob of millionaires, all holding out their silk hats for a penny; or all shouting with one voice, “Give me money.” Yet advertisement does really assault the eye very much as such a shout would assault the ear. “Budge&#39;s Boots are the Best” simply means “Give me money”; “Use Seraphic Soap” simply means “Give me money.” It is a complete mistake to suppose that common people make our towns commonplace, with unsightly things like advertisements. Most of those whose wares are thus placarded everywhere are very wealthy gentlemen with coronets and country seats, men who are probably very particular about the artistic adornment of their own homes.

It&#39;s because they&#39;ve become increasingly obnoxious. Nobody blocked ads when they were a simple column of links in the gutter or maybe an animated GIF banner with 3 frames. No, adblockers became popular because ads kept getting more loud (both visually and audibly), in your face, and resource hungry (remember those flash ads that&#39;d keep your CPU pegged?).

Some of those descendants are very successful now and some descendants of slave owners are probably very poor now. And some people are descendants of both. And then I learn about the Jim Crow period, and then you hear that even the GI bill explicitly excluded black people, and lynchings into the 1950s, and the extremely hard fight the civil rights movement had, and even legal discrimination up to 1971, not to mention tons of possibly illegal but still very real discrimination after that. And then I think: you can&#39;t just stop doing a bad thing and pretend it didn&#39;t happen. You&#39;ve got to try to make things right. Have things been made right by now? I have no idea. I do know plenty of black people still live in fear of the police, and that when black people call the police, there&#39;s the non-zero chance that they&#39;re the ones who end up getting shot. Not to mention that many universities also have affirmative action for children of alumni, who are still predominantly white and rich, partially because of the legal discrimination uo to 1971, and partially because universities are ridiculously expensive. Has that affirmative action also been struck down? >; America is not in the least social-democratic, It used to be, though.

Right? I mean, I can get behind that. But then why the entire detour with race? Up until about 1971 (possibly later, but that&#39;s the date of <i>Loving vs Virginia</i> ), the US had formal, legal discrimination against black people. On finally removing that, there was at various times discussion of whether people who had been legally discriminated against all their lives should be compensated, as if they had been wronged in a tort sense. This would obviously be extremely expensive, and anyway impossible to quantify, so it never happened. Harvard, and many other colleges, has a big base of &quot;legacy&quot; admissions, as well as a certain amount of generational knowledge and connections - you&#39;re more likely to get into Harvard if your parents went to Harvard, over and above mere class status. Since black people were under-represented in this category, people came up with the idea of putting a thumb on the other side of the scale and artificially increasing their rate of admission. Can it balance exactly against the disadvantages of discrimination? No. >; I genuinely don&#39;t get why the race thing is part of the equation. Shouldn&#39;t this just be run-of-the-mill social democratic &quot;lets hand out some extra opportunities/benefits to the poor&quot; program?

Affirmative Action probably helped my father, whose father was a construction worker and mother a homemaker both of whom dropped out of high school, get into college and ultimately become a doctor.

But it also feels totally irrelevant to me, personally, because of my upper class upbringing and elite education, and I feel like I&#39;ve never really been discriminated against. Though I possibly have been discriminated &quot;for&quot;, and benefited tremendously from it. So I don&#39;t know how I feel about this change. It&#39;s certainly a big one, but in the long run, maybe it&#39;s good?

And advertisement is the rich asking for more money. A man would be annoyed if he found himself in a mob of millionaires, all holding out their silk hats for a penny; or all shouting with one voice, “Give me money.” Yet advertisement does really assault the eye very much as such a shout would assault the ear. “Budge&#39;s Boots are the Best” simply means “Give me money”; “Use Seraphic Soap” simply means “Give me money.” It is a complete mistake to suppose that common people make our towns commonplace, with unsightly things like advertisements. Most of those whose wares are thus placarded everywhere are very wealthy gentlemen with coronets and country seats, men who are probably very particular about the artistic adornment of their own homes.

It&#39;s because they&#39;ve become increasingly obnoxious. Nobody blocked ads when they were a simple column of links in the gutter or maybe an animated GIF banner with 3 frames. No, adblockers became popular because ads kept getting more loud (both visually and audibly), in your face, and resource hungry (remember those flash ads that&#39;d keep your CPU pegged?).

Some of those descendants are very successful now and some descendants of slave owners are probably very poor now. And some people are descendants of both. And then I learn about the Jim Crow period, and then you hear that even the GI bill explicitly excluded black people, and lynchings into the 1950s, and the extremely hard fight the civil rights movement had, and even legal discrimination up to 1971, not to mention tons of possibly illegal but still very real discrimination after that. And then I think: you can&#39;t just stop doing a bad thing and pretend it didn&#39;t happen. You&#39;ve got to try to make things right. Have things been made right by now? I have no idea. I do know plenty of black people still live in fear of the police, and that when black people call the police, there&#39;s the non-zero chance that they&#39;re the ones who end up getting shot. Not to mention that many universities also have affirmative action for children of alumni, who are still predominantly white and rich, partially because of the legal discrimination uo to 1971, and partially because universities are ridiculously expensive. Has that affirmative action also been struck down? >; America is not in the least social-democratic, It used to be, though.

Right? I mean, I can get behind that. But then why the entire detour with race? Up until about 1971 (possibly later, but that&#39;s the date of <i>Loving vs Virginia</i> ), the US had formal, legal discrimination against black people. On finally removing that, there was at various times discussion of whether people who had been legally discriminated against all their lives should be compensated, as if they had been wronged in a tort sense. This would obviously be extremely expensive, and anyway impossible to quantify, so it never happened. Harvard, and many other colleges, has a big base of &quot;legacy&quot; admissions, as well as a certain amount of generational knowledge and connections - you&#39;re more likely to get into Harvard if your parents went to Harvard, over and above mere class status. Since black people were under-represented in this category, people came up with the idea of putting a thumb on the other side of the scale and artificially increasing their rate of admission. Can it balance exactly against the disadvantages of discrimination? No. >; I genuinely don&#39;t get why the race thing is part of the equation. Shouldn&#39;t this just be run-of-the-mill social democratic &quot;lets hand out some extra opportunities/benefits to the poor&quot; program? America is not in the least social-democratic, but racism and anti-racism have been there since the beginning and will probably dominate US politics until the last person who remembers the KKK is dead.

But it also feels totally irrelevant to me, personally, because of my upper class upbringing and elite education, and I feel like I&#39;ve never really been discriminated against. Though I possibly have been discriminated &quot;for&quot;, and benefited tremendously from it. So I don&#39;t know how I feel about this change. It&#39;s certainly a big one, but in the long run, maybe it&#39;s good?

And advertisement is the rich asking for more money. A man would be annoyed if he found himself in a mob of millionaires, all holding out their silk hats for a penny; or all shouting with one voice, “Give me money.” Yet advertisement does really assault the eye very much as such a shout would assault the ear. “Budge&#39;s Boots are the Best” simply means “Give me money”; “Use Seraphic Soap” simply means “Give me money.” It is a complete mistake to suppose that common people make our towns commonplace, with unsightly things like advertisements. Most of those whose wares are thus placarded everywhere are very wealthy gentlemen with coronets and country seats, men who are probably very particular about the artistic adornment of their own homes.

They&#39;ll eagerly exploit a teenager&#39;s self-conscious body issues to sell useless beauty products.

It&#39;s because they&#39;ve become increasingly obnoxious. Nobody blocked ads when they were a simple column of links in the gutter or maybe an animated GIF banner with 3 frames. No, adblockers became popular because ads kept getting more loud (both visually and audibly), in your face, and resource hungry (remember those flash ads that&#39;d keep your CPU pegged?).

Some of those descendants are very successful now and some descendants of slave owners are probably very poor now. And some people are descendants of both. And then I learn about the Jim Crow period, and then you hear that even the GI bill explicitly excluded black people, and lynchings into the 1950s, and the extremely hard fight the civil rights movement had, and even legal discrimination up to 1971, not to mention tons of possibly illegal but still very real discrimination after that. And then I think: you can&#39;t just stop doing a bad thing and pretend it didn&#39;t happen. You&#39;ve got to try to make things right. Have things been made right by now? I have no idea. I do know plenty of black people still live in fear of the police, and that when black people call the police, there&#39;s the non-zero chance that they&#39;re the ones who end up getting shot. Not to mention that many universities also have affirmative action for children of alumni, who are still predominantly white and rich, partially because of the legal discrimination uo to 1971, and partially because universities are ridiculously expensive. Has that affirmative action also been struck down? >; America is not in the least social-democratic, It used to be, though.

Right? I mean, I can get behind that. But then why the entire detour with race? Up until about 1971 (possibly later, but that&#39;s the date of <i>Loving vs Virginia</i> ), the US had formal, legal discrimination against black people. On finally removing that, there was at various times discussion of whether people who had been legally discriminated against all their lives should be compensated, as if they had been wronged in a tort sense. This would obviously be extremely expensive, and anyway impossible to quantify, so it never happened. Harvard, and many other colleges, has a big base of &quot;legacy&quot; admissions, as well as a certain amount of generational knowledge and connections - you&#39;re more likely to get into Harvard if your parents went to Harvard, over and above mere class status. Since black people were under-represented in this category, people came up with the idea of putting a thumb on the other side of the scale and artificially increasing their rate of admission. Can it balance exactly against the disadvantages of discrimination? No. >; I genuinely don&#39;t get why the race thing is part of the equation. Shouldn&#39;t this just be run-of-the-mill social democratic &quot;lets hand out some extra opportunities/benefits to the poor&quot; program? America is not in the least social-democratic, but racism and anti-racism have been there since the beginning and will probably dominate US politics until the last person who remembers the KKK is dead.

Affirmative Action probably helped my father, whose father was a construction worker and mother a homemaker both of whom dropped out of high school, get into college and ultimately become a doctor. But because my father was a doctor, I had a fairly privileged upbringing. I&#39;m a generation removed, but growing up in California always had to indicate my background on standardized tests and always checked &quot;White&quot; for race and then &quot;Hispanic&quot; for ethnicity (which is how all the tests asked it in those days, not sure if it&#39;s still the case), without thinking much about it.

But it also feels totally irrelevant to me, personally, because of my upper class upbringing and elite education, and I feel like I&#39;ve never really been discriminated against. Though I possibly have been discriminated &quot;for&quot;, and benefited tremendously from it. So I don&#39;t know how I feel about this change. It&#39;s certainly a big one, but in the long run, maybe it&#39;s good?

And advertisement is the rich asking for more money. A man would be annoyed if he found himself in a mob of millionaires, all holding out their silk hats for a penny; or all shouting with one voice, “Give me money.” Yet advertisement does really assault the eye very much as such a shout would assault the ear. “Budge&#39;s Boots are the Best” simply means “Give me money”; “Use Seraphic Soap” simply means “Give me money.” It is a complete mistake to suppose that common people make our towns commonplace, with unsightly things like advertisements. Most of those whose wares are thus placarded everywhere are very wealthy gentlemen with coronets and country seats, men who are probably very particular about the artistic adornment of their own homes. They disfigure their towns in order to decorate their houses. — GK Chesterton, <i>The New Jersusalem</i> <a href="http://www.gkc.org.uk/gkc/books/GKC_New_Jerusalem.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.gkc.org.uk/gkc/books/GKC_New_Jerusalem.html</a> ]]>; Fri, 30 Jun 2023 16:11:03 +0000</span> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 lolinder https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 I block ads because they&#39;re psychological warfare that corporations wage against me. I don&#39;t care how unobtrusive the ads are. I don&#39;t care if the ads don&#39;t track me.

I have zero tolerance for ads of any sort. Advertisers have no morals, they&#39;re completely depraved. They&#39;ll eagerly exploit a teenager&#39;s self-conscious body issues to sell useless beauty products.

It&#39;s because they&#39;ve become increasingly obnoxious. Nobody blocked ads when they were a simple column of links in the gutter or maybe an animated GIF banner with 3 frames. No, adblockers became popular because ads kept getting more loud (both visually and audibly), in your face, and resource hungry (remember those flash ads that&#39;d keep your CPU pegged?).

I&#39;ve always had an identity crisis about what I am. I know in the current zeitgeist there&#39;s a big push for racial justice, of which being Hispanic and &quot;brown&quot; is a part. But it also feels totally irrelevant to me, personally, because of my upper class upbringing and elite education, and I feel like I&#39;ve never really been discriminated against. Though I possibly have been discriminated &quot;for&quot;, and benefited tremendously from it. So I don&#39;t know how I feel about this change. It&#39;s certainly a big one, but in the long run, maybe it&#39;s good? I know I&#39;ve always wondered if being Hispanic helped me get into college or into jobs, but the flip side is that other people must wonder the same... ]]>; Thu, 29 Jun 2023 14:40:31 +0000</span> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36520992 losvedir https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36520992 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36520992 I don&#39;t buy this. Hacker News is one of the most responsive websites I know. And it is run on a single server somewhere in the USA. While I am in Europe.<code> If you have users in Sydney, Australia ... ... you are floored at 104ms of latency for your request</code> When I open AirBnB with a clean browser cache, it takes several seconds until I see something useful. Those 104ms of latency don&#39;t make a dent. Reddit takes over 5 seconds until the cookie banner is ready for me to click it away. Twitter takes 6 seconds to load the homepage and display the single tweet which fits on it.<code> preview images take a little longer to load</code> Preview images of what? Images usually should be routed through a CDN which caches them directly in the user&#39;s country. It&#39;s extremely cheap and easy to set up. Nothing compared to running an application in multiple datacenters. ]]>; Thu, 29 Jun 2023 05:53:22 +0000</span> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36516842 TekMol https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36516842 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36516842 It&#39;s hypocritical for people here to dismay about the fall of print journalism and long-form writing, when every article from a paid source is followed by a <a href="https://archive.is/xyz" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://archive.is/xyz</a> link. ]]>; Thu, 29 Jun 2023 01:05:45 +0000</span> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36515033 khazhoux https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36515033 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36515033 &quot;We raised a bunch of money&quot; Generally speaking (I&#39;m not a fly.io customer) at this point that phrase WORRIES me as a customer of any service. It makes me think that the company exists just on a constant flow of VC or similar money and what I&#39;m using or paying for isn&#39;t a realistic or future cost and I&#39;m involved with a system or platform that is getting stretched larger and larger regardless of income and the more money they raise the harder the fall will be. It&#39;s unfortunate but for me it&#39;s not a phrase I want to see. I want to hear how they are profitable based on their operations and paying customers or other non VC or IPO type income. That gives me confidence in their stability. To be clear that&#39;s not a disagreement with the title or blog, seems like a fine article that is fairly up front, but it&#39;s hard for me to really see &quot;we raised a bunch of money&quot; as a positive from a customer perspective anymore. ]]>; Wed, 28 Jun 2023 16:24:00 +0000</span> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36508732 duxup https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36508732 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36508732</code></guid></item></channel></rss>
