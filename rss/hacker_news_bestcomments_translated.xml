Up until about 1971 (possibly later, but that&#39;s the date of <i>Loving vs Virginia</i> ), the US had formal, legal discrimination against black people. On finally removing that, there was at various times discussion of whether people who had been legally discriminated against all their lives should be compensated, as if they had been wronged in a tort sense. This would obviously be extremely expensive, and anyway impossible to quantify, so it never happened. Harvard, and many other colleges, has a big base of &quot;legacy&quot; admissions, as well as a certain amount of generational knowledge and connections - you&#39;re more likely to get into Harvard if your parents went to Harvard, over and above mere class status. Since black people were under-represented in this category, people came up with the idea of putting a thumb on the other side of the scale and artificially increasing their rate of admission. Can it balance exactly against the disadvantages of discrimination? No. >; I genuinely don&#39;t get why the race thing is part of the equation.

A man would be annoyed if he found himself in a mob of millionaires, all holding out their silk hats for a penny; or all shouting with one voice, “Give me money.” Yet advertisement does really assault the eye very much as such a shout would assault the ear. “Budge&#39;s Boots are the Best” simply means “Give me money”; “Use Seraphic Soap” simply means “Give me money.” It is a complete mistake to suppose that common people make our towns commonplace, with unsightly things like advertisements. Most of those whose wares are thus placarded everywhere are very wealthy gentlemen with coronets and country seats, men who are probably very particular about the artistic adornment of their own homes. They disfigure their towns in order to decorate their houses. — GK Chesterton, <i>The New Jersusalem</i> <a href="http://www.gkc.org.uk/gkc/books/GKC_New_Jerusalem.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.gkc.org.uk/gkc/books/GKC_New_Jerusalem.html</a> ]]>; Fri, 30 Jun 2023 16:11:03 +0000</span> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 lolinder https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36537564 I block ads because they&#39;re psychological warfare that corporations wage against me. I don&#39;t care how unobtrusive the ads are. I don&#39;t care if the ads don&#39;t track me. I grew up changing the channel on TV when ads came on, and ripping adverts out of magazines before sitting down to read them. I vote for billboard bans whenever I can. I have zero tolerance for ads of any sort. Advertisers have no morals, they&#39;re completely depraved. They&#39;ll eagerly exploit a teenager&#39;s self-conscious body issues to sell useless beauty products. They sell sugar water to fat people and at every turn promote the rampant consumerist culture that is destroying our planet. They&#39;re lower than pond scum and I never want to see a single ad from them ever. ]]>; Fri, 30 Jun 2023 15:36:41 +0000</span> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36536895 mcpackieh https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36536895 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36536895 This doesn&#39;t really affect me since I subscribe to premium, but something that a lot of ad-based services don&#39;t seem to grasp is <i>why</i> people block ads. It&#39;s because they&#39;ve become increasingly obnoxious. Nobody blocked ads when they were a simple column of links in the gutter or maybe an animated GIF banner with 3 frames. No, adblockers became popular because ads kept getting more loud (both visually and audibly), in your face, and resource hungry (remember those flash ads that&#39;d keep your CPU pegged?). The web became unusable if you didn&#39;t have a blocker installed. Web advertisers seem like a classic case of taking miles when given an inch. ]]>; Fri, 30 Jun 2023 14:51:29 +0000</span> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36535906 kitsunesoba https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36535906 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36535906 Boggles the mind why people still fall for the iPad Pro as a serious work machine beyond writing meme. The fact that Final Cut launched on it recently and while its exporting you have to sit there leaving the app open you can&#39;t go do something else is the punchline of the decade for the lie that this is a serious machine. This is before we get into the comical evolution from &quot;You just need the touchscreen&quot; to &quot;Actually physical keys are good for long typing&quot; iPad and a keyboard case, to &quot;oh actually a cursor would be useful to do real work&quot; to full blown iPad + trackpad case awkward laptop form factor.

The reason you don&#39;t see long term support on Android is because of Qualcomm. Qualcomm wants manufacturers to build on new chips, so they deprecate older chips and stop support. Most manufacturers don&#39;t want to hire kernel and hardware devs. Samsung can pull off longer support because of Exynos and they have a lot of inhouse expertise to extend support on old Qualcomm chips. It&#39;s all money. They don&#39;t want you keeping a phone for 5 years. Apple can do it because they lock you into their walled garden where they can double and triple dip on getting your money. They also build their own chips. ]]>; Fri, 30 Jun 2023 04:52:48 +0000</span> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36530645 Daegalus https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36530645 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36530645 Many people who would otherwise be appalled at laws like this seem to want to rationalize this because its specifically targeting Google and Meta.

Right? I mean, I can get behind that. But then why the entire detour with race? Up until about 1971 (possibly later, but that&#39;s the date of <i>Loving vs Virginia</i> ), the US had formal, legal discrimination against black people. On finally removing that, there was at various times discussion of whether people who had been legally discriminated against all their lives should be compensated, as if they had been wronged in a tort sense. This would obviously be extremely expensive, and anyway impossible to quantify, so it never happened. Harvard, and many other colleges, has a big base of &quot;legacy&quot; admissions, as well as a certain amount of generational knowledge and connections - you&#39;re more likely to get into Harvard if your parents went to Harvard, over and above mere class status. Since black people were under-represented in this category, people came up with the idea of putting a thumb on the other side of the scale and artificially increasing their rate of admission. Can it balance exactly against the disadvantages of discrimination? No. >; I genuinely don&#39;t get why the race thing is part of the equation. Shouldn&#39;t this just be run-of-the-mill social democratic &quot;lets hand out some extra opportunities/benefits to the poor&quot; program? America is not in the least social-democratic, but racism and anti-racism have been there since the beginning and will probably dominate US politics until the last person who remembers the KKK is dead. (It could be worse: Haitians who had freed themselves from slavery by the mass murder of their oppressors were made to pay a huge amount of compensation to them!) ]]>; Thu, 29 Jun 2023 15:47:11 +0000</span> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36522049 pjc50 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36522049 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36522049 The concept of affirmative action is foreign to me (quite literally so). I only know it from American media, and I&#39;ve come understand it to mean &quot;positively discriminate based on race, so long as it&#39;s a minority race&quot; - please correct me of I&#39;m wrong. But anyway, my question for the Americans here who grok this stuff: I assume the intent is to help disadvantaged people have opportunities that more priviledged people have already. Right? I mean, I can get behind that. But then why the entire detour with race? Why not just.. well, let poor people come first?
