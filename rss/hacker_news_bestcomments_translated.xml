Some of those descendants are very successful now and some descendants of slave owners are probably very poor now. And some people are descendants of both. And then I learn about the Jim Crow period, and then you hear that even the GI bill explicitly excluded black people, and lynchings into the 1950s, and the extremely hard fight the civil rights movement had, and even legal discrimination up to 1971, not to mention tons of possibly illegal but still very real discrimination after that. And then I think: you can&#39;t just stop doing a bad thing and pretend it didn&#39;t happen. You&#39;ve got to try to make things right. Have things been made right by now? I have no idea. I do know plenty of black people still live in fear of the police, and that when black people call the police, there&#39;s the non-zero chance that they&#39;re the ones who end up getting shot. Not to mention that many universities also have affirmative action for children of alumni, who are still predominantly white and rich, partially because of the legal discrimination uo to 1971, and partially because universities are ridiculously expensive. Has that affirmative action also been struck down? >; America is not in the least social-democratic, It used to be, though. The New Deal and many of the social policies of the 1940s and 1950s were very social democratic. Well, except that they tended to exclude black people. ]]>; Thu, 29 Jun 2023 15:57:26 +0000</span> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36522205 mcv https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36522205 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36522205 >; I assume the intent is to help disadvantaged people have opportunities that more priviledged people have already. Right? I mean, I can get behind that. But then why the entire detour with race? Up until about 1971 (possibly later, but that&#39;s the date of <i>Loving vs Virginia</i> ), the US had formal, legal discrimination against black people. On finally removing that, there was at various times discussion of whether people who had been legally discriminated against all their lives should be compensated, as if they had been wronged in a tort sense. This would obviously be extremely expensive, and anyway impossible to quantify, so it never happened. Harvard, and many other colleges, has a big base of &quot;legacy&quot; admissions, as well as a certain amount of generational knowledge and connections - you&#39;re more likely to get into Harvard if your parents went to Harvard, over and above mere class status. Since black people were under-represented in this category, people came up with the idea of putting a thumb on the other side of the scale and artificially increasing their rate of admission. Can it balance exactly against the disadvantages of discrimination? No. >; I genuinely don&#39;t get why the race thing is part of the equation. Shouldn&#39;t this just be run-of-the-mill social democratic &quot;lets hand out some extra opportunities/benefits to the poor&quot; program? America is not in the least social-democratic, but racism and anti-racism have been there since the beginning and will probably dominate US politics until the last person who remembers the KKK is dead. (It could be worse: Haitians who had freed themselves from slavery by the mass murder of their oppressors were made to pay a huge amount of compensation to them!) ]]>; Thu, 29 Jun 2023 15:47:11 +0000</span> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36522049 pjc50 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36522049 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36522049 The concept of affirmative action is foreign to me (quite literally so). I only know it from American media, and I&#39;ve come understand it to mean &quot;positively discriminate based on race, so long as it&#39;s a minority race&quot; - please correct me of I&#39;m wrong. But anyway, my question for the Americans here who grok this stuff: I assume the intent is to help disadvantaged people have opportunities that more priviledged people have already. Right? I mean, I can get behind that. But then why the entire detour with race? Why not just.. well, let poor people come first?

And then I think: you can&#39;t just stop doing a bad thing and pretend it didn&#39;t happen. You&#39;ve got to try to make things right. Have things been made right by now? I have no idea. I do know plenty of black people still live in fear of the police, and that when black people call the police, there&#39;s the non-zero chance that they&#39;re the ones who end up getting shot.

Some of those descendants are very successful now and some descendants of slave owners are probably very poor now. And some people are descendants of both. And then I learn about the Jim Crow period, and then you hear that even the GI bill explicitly excluded black people, and lynchings into the 1950s, and the extremely hard fight the civil rights movement had, and even legal discrimination up to 1971, not to mention tons of possibly illegal but still very real discrimination after that. And then I think: you can&#39;t just stop doing a bad thing and pretend it didn&#39;t happen. You&#39;ve got to try to make things right. Have things been made right by now? I have no idea. I do know plenty of black people still live in fear of the police, and that when black people call the police, there&#39;s the non-zero chance that they&#39;re the ones who end up getting shot.

Right? I mean, I can get behind that. But then why the entire detour with race? Up until about 1971 (possibly later, but that&#39;s the date of <i>Loving vs Virginia</i> ), the US had formal, legal discrimination against black people. On finally removing that, there was at various times discussion of whether people who had been legally discriminated against all their lives should be compensated, as if they had been wronged in a tort sense. This would obviously be extremely expensive, and anyway impossible to quantify, so it never happened. Harvard, and many other colleges, has a big base of &quot;legacy&quot; admissions, as well as a certain amount of generational knowledge and connections - you&#39;re more likely to get into Harvard if your parents went to Harvard, over and above mere class status. Since black people were under-represented in this category, people came up with the idea of putting a thumb on the other side of the scale and artificially increasing their rate of admission.

Some of those descendants are very successful now and some descendants of slave owners are probably very poor now. And some people are descendants of both. And then I learn about the Jim Crow period, and then you hear that even the GI bill explicitly excluded black people, and lynchings into the 1950s, and the extremely hard fight the civil rights movement had, and even legal discrimination up to 1971, not to mention tons of possibly illegal but still very real discrimination after that. And then I think: you can&#39;t just stop doing a bad thing and pretend it didn&#39;t happen. You&#39;ve got to try to make things right. Have things been made right by now? I have no idea. I do know plenty of black people still live in fear of the police, and that when black people call the police, there&#39;s the non-zero chance that they&#39;re the ones who end up getting shot. Not to mention that many universities also have affirmative action for children of alumni, who are still predominantly white and rich, partially because of the legal discrimination uo to 1971, and partially because universities are ridiculously expensive.

They also build their own chips. ]]>; Fri, 30 Jun 2023 04:52:48 +0000</span> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36530645 Daegalus https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36530645 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36530645 Many people who would otherwise be appalled at laws like this seem to want to rationalize this because its specifically targeting Google and Meta. Sometimes taking the simple view is correct: It&#39;s a bad thing to prevent sites from linking to one another. It&#39;s a bad thing to interfere with the ability to access information on the Internet for reasons of nationalist politics. ]]>; Thu, 29 Jun 2023 19:14:35 +0000</span> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36525349 paddw https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36525349 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36525349 Everytime github goes down, and my push/pull is rejected, I immediately assume they&#39;ve discovered I&#39;m incompetent and fired me.

Some of those descendants are very successful now and some descendants of slave owners are probably very poor now. And some people are descendants of both. And then I learn about the Jim Crow period, and then you hear that even the GI bill explicitly excluded black people, and lynchings into the 1950s, and the extremely hard fight the civil rights movement had, and even legal discrimination up to 1971, not to mention tons of possibly illegal but still very real discrimination after that. And then I think: you can&#39;t just stop doing a bad thing and pretend it didn&#39;t happen. You&#39;ve got to try to make things right. Have things been made right by now? I have no idea. I do know plenty of black people still live in fear of the police, and that when black people call the police, there&#39;s the non-zero chance that they&#39;re the ones who end up getting shot. Not to mention that many universities also have affirmative action for children of alumni, who are still predominantly white and rich, partially because of the legal discrimination uo to 1971, and partially because universities are ridiculously expensive. Has that affirmative action also been struck down? >; America is not in the least social-democratic, It used to be, though. The New Deal and many of the social policies of the 1940s and 1950s were very social democratic. Well, except that they tended to exclude black people. ]]>; Thu, 29 Jun 2023 15:57:26 +0000</span> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36522205 mcv https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36522205 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36522205 >; I assume the intent is to help disadvantaged people have opportunities that more priviledged people have already. Right? I mean, I can get behind that. But then why the entire detour with race? Up until about 1971 (possibly later, but that&#39;s the date of <i>Loving vs Virginia</i> ), the US had formal, legal discrimination against black people. On finally removing that, there was at various times discussion of whether people who had been legally discriminated against all their lives should be compensated, as if they had been wronged in a tort sense. This would obviously be extremely expensive, and anyway impossible to quantify, so it never happened. Harvard, and many other colleges, has a big base of &quot;legacy&quot; admissions, as well as a certain amount of generational knowledge and connections - you&#39;re more likely to get into Harvard if your parents went to Harvard, over and above mere class status. Since black people were under-represented in this category, people came up with the idea of putting a thumb on the other side of the scale and artificially increasing their rate of admission. Can it balance exactly against the disadvantages of discrimination? No. >; I genuinely don&#39;t get why the race thing is part of the equation. Shouldn&#39;t this just be run-of-the-mill social democratic &quot;lets hand out some extra opportunities/benefits to the poor&quot; program? America is not in the least social-democratic, but racism and anti-racism have been there since the beginning and will probably dominate US politics until the last person who remembers the KKK is dead. (It could be worse: Haitians who had freed themselves from slavery by the mass murder of their oppressors were made to pay a huge amount of compensation to them!) ]]>; Thu, 29 Jun 2023 15:47:11 +0000</span> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36522049 pjc50 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36522049 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36522049 The concept of affirmative action is foreign to me (quite literally so). I only know it from American media, and I&#39;ve come understand it to mean &quot;positively discriminate based on race, so long as it&#39;s a minority race&quot; - please correct me of I&#39;m wrong. But anyway, my question for the Americans here who grok this stuff: I assume the intent is to help disadvantaged people have opportunities that more priviledged people have already. Right? I mean, I can get behind that. But then why the entire detour with race? Why not just.. well, let poor people come first? Would the goal suddenly not be met if poor smart white kids get into good schools, too? Who loses in this case? I don&#39;t mean this as a hihi actually sneaky anti-affirmative-action post, I don&#39;t understand the subject matter well enough (nor America in general).
